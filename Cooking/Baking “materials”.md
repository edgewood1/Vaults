You have hit on the single most important concept in baking physics: Structure vs. Flavor.
You are generally correct. In 90% of Western baking, Wheat Flour is the "main" ingredient because it is the structural skeleton, while Cornmeal (and other grains like oats or rye) acts more like "gravel" or "sand"—it adds texture and flavor, but it struggles to hold the building up on its own.
Here is the breakdown of why they act so differently.
1. Wheat Flour: The "Steel Beams" (Structure)
Wheat flour is unique among almost all grains because it contains two specific proteins (glutenin and gliadin) that, when wet and mixed, combine to form Gluten.
 * What it does: Gluten forms an elastic web—imagine a balloon or a net.
 * The Result: When your leavening agent (yeast or baking soda) creates gas bubbles, the gluten "net" stretches and traps the gas, allowing the bread or cake to rise high and hold its shape.
 * Without it: The gas bubbles would just escape, and the cake would collapse into a dense puck.
2. Cornmeal: The "Bricks" (Body & Flavor)
Cornmeal is not just a flavoring—it is a starch, so it provides body and bulk. However, it has zero gluten.
 * What it does: It creates a "sandy" or crumbly texture. It cannot stretch.
 * The Result: If you try to bake a loaf of bread using only cornmeal and yeast, it will not rise. It will be a heavy, flat brick because the gas bubbles will pop immediately (there is no "net" to catch them).
 * The "Flavoring" aspect: You are right that in many recipes (like muffins or pancakes), cornmeal is added primarily for that specific "corny" taste and the pleasant crunchy grit, while wheat flour is still doing the heavy lifting to make it fluffy.
The "Cornbread" Example
To see this in action, look at the two ways Cornbread is made. This perfectly illustrates the difference:
| Type | Ingredients | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Northern/Sweet Cornbread | 50% Wheat Flour / 50% Cornmeal | Tall, fluffy, cake-like. The wheat flour provides the lift; the cornmeal provides the taste. |
| Traditional Southern Cornbread | 100% Cornmeal (No Wheat) | Dense, flat, crumbly, and very crusty. It relies on egg and hot skillet frying for structure, not gluten. |
Summary
 * Wheat Flour: The Contractor. It builds the house and holds the roof up.
 * Cornmeal: The Material. It creates the walls and determines the look/feel, but it usually needs the contractor (wheat) to help it stand up straight.
Would you like to know about "Cake Flour" vs "Bread Flour"—is that just a marketing trick, or does it actually change the structure?

Using the "Contractor" (Wheat) vs. "Material" (Cornmeal) analogy, there are many other ingredients bakers use as Materials. These ingredients provide specific flavors, textures, or colors, but if you used them alone without a "Contractor," your building would collapse.
Here are the most common "Materials" used alongside (or instead of) wheat flour:
1. Rye (The "Heavy Brick")
Rye is the closest cousin to wheat, but it behaves very differently. It has chemistry that makes dough sticky and heavy rather than elastic.
 * What it adds: A deep, earthy, sour flavor and a very dense, moist texture.
 * How it's used: Usually mixed with wheat flour (like in "Marble Rye").
 * The Result: If you make 100% rye bread (like German Pumpernickel), it is essentially a dense, dark brick that is sliced very thin. It has almost zero fluffiness.
2. Oats (The "Texturizer")
Oats (rolled, steel-cut, or oat flour) have no gluten. They are heavy and soft.
 * What it adds: A nutty sweetness and a distinct "chewiness."
 * How it's used: Oatmeal cookies, crumble toppings, or added to bread dough for texture.
 * The Result: Oats break up the gluten network. If you add too many oats to bread, the loaf will be short and heavy because the oats physically cut the "steel beams" of the gluten.
3. Almond Flour / Nut Meals (The "Insulation")
Ground nuts are high in fat and protein but have zero starch or elasticity.
 * What it adds: incredible moisture, richness (fat), and tenderness.
 * How it's used: Macarons, Financiers, or substituting a portion of flour in cakes to keep them moist longer.
 * The Result: Because nuts are oily, they weigh down the batter. They make things tender and soft, never chewy or crispy.
4. Buckwheat (The "Flavor Bomb")
Despite the name, this is not wheat (it's related to rhubarb). It is technically a seed.
 * What it adds: A dark color and a very strong, bitter, grassy flavor.
 * How it's used: Buckwheat pancakes, crêpes (Galettes), or blini.
 * The Result: It has a "sandy" texture similar to cornmeal but much finer. It provides zero lift, which is why buckwheat pancakes are generally flatter than regular ones.
5. Rice Flour (The "Crisper")
Rice flour is very hard and gritty compared to soft wheat flour.
 * What it adds: Crunch.
 * How it's used: It is often added to shortbread cookies or tempura batter.
 * The Result: It doesn't absorb water as easily as wheat, so it dries out faster in the oven, creating a "snap" or "crunch" rather than a "chew."
6. Cocoa Powder (The "Dryer")
You might not think of this as a flour, but physically, it acts like one. It is a dry powder that absorbs liquid.
 * What it adds: Chocolate flavor, obviously, but also dryness.
 * How it's used: In chocolate cake.
 * The Result: When you add cocoa to a recipe, you usually have to remove an equal amount of flour, or the cake will be too dry. But because cocoa has no gluten, a chocolate cake is structurally weaker (more crumbly) than a vanilla cake.
Summary Table
| Material | The "Vibe" it Adds | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Cornmeal | Gritty, Sweet | Cornbread, Pizza Crust bottom |
| Rye | Dense, Sour, Sticky | Reubens, Sourdough blends |
| Oats | Chewy, Chunky | Cookies, Muffins |
| Almond Flour | Moist, Tender, Rich | Macarons, upscale cakes |
| Rice Flour | Crispy, Snappy | Shortbread, frying batter |
| Buckwheat | Earthy, Bitter | Pancakes, Crêpes |
The "Gluten-Free" Exception:
You might ask, "How do people make gluten-free bread if they only have Materials and no Contractor?"
In Gluten-Free baking, because they can't use Wheat (The Contractor), they have to hire a different Contractor. Usually, this is a gum, like Xanthan Gum or Psyllium Husk. These are slimy ingredients that glue the rice/almond/oat flours together to mimic the "net" that wheat would have provided naturally.
