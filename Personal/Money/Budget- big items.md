July 2025 - let’s add bigger items from credit card bill here (over $100) and get Chat GPT to do the math. (**can we move this to excel?)**
- Health items (heart scans, testical scan, Garmin cameras, Jo desk, New Juniper tree, Rugs porch, etc.)

**Table 1: Main Expenses + Mac**

Below is the table with the new totals. The total price of all items listed is $25,734. The total for purchased items only, which excludes the "Skip" items, is $23,534.

* This only puts us at 6K buffer - otherwise, we break even by next March - around 11K in bank account
* Normal pay 1600 ; otherwise 3K (1400 more)
* If I skip 4 more, then we’d have 17K - is it worth it?  
* I’d have less money in my 401, which is growing. 
* Should we bet on a gift later this year?
