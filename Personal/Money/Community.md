# Community


The word community seems to be used as placeholder for their business.  This seems dishonest.   Wade rented rooms as affordable rates to students and those undergoing life transitions.   This seems closer to the apirit of community.   As does opening to neighborhood groups.   Then does using the space for herbal and massage treatments and workshops.   They should just state that this is the new home of their business and would like to raise  money for repairs. Rather than insist this is a community project space.
