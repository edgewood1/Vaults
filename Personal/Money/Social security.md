# Social security


If you retire at age 60, you can’t claim Social Security until age 62. At that point, your benefit will be reduced because you’re claiming before your Full Retirement Age (FRA).Assuming your FRA is **67**, claiming at **62** results in a **30% reduction**:
At **age 62**, your benefit will be approximately **$1,066/month**.
If you delay benefits until **age 67 (FRA)**, you’d receive **$1,523/month**.
At **age 70**, benefits would grow to about **$1,890/month** (with delayed credits).

40-16￼k needed per year?? 

So if between 59 and 67, I need 40K per year to get by, and then between 67 until  death I need 25K PER year (due to social security extra), how long would 600,000 last if it gets a return of 4.5%

If you start with $600,000, earn an annual return of 4.5%, and need $40,000 per year until age 67, followed by $25,000 per year until age 100:

Your savings would last **41 years**, covering all expenses from age 59 to age 100.
At age 100, you would still have approximately **$224,336** remaining in your account.
