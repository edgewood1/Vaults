# My blog



Two locations
* iCloud: "/Users/meldejesus/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/blog
* GitHub: git@github.com:edgewood1/Blog.git


Vault
* Icloud: /Users/meldejesus/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents

My iCloud git status shows deleted files. 
* Is this the most recent changes? 
* Do I need to pull from remote? How do I tell? 


* **The Fix:** If you proceed with this, ensure you **disable "Optimize Mac Storage"** on your Mac, or at least right-click the Obsidian folder in Finder and select **"Download Now"** (or "Keep Downloaded" on macOS Sonoma+) to ensure the files are always local.
