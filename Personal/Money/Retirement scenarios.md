Mel is 55 and will retire now. 
he will go on his wife’s health insurance. 
He will collect social security at 62 and so will she. 
He has 200K in his 401K
Kathy is 48 and will retire at 58.  
She has 200K in her 401K. 
After taxes, she brings home 55K. 
We have 600K in stocks in a joint account. 
80K for our 7 year old daughter.  
We expect to live until 92 each. 
We have no debts. 
What can we expect to have as a stead annual post-tax income for the next 38 years? 

✅ ****You can expect a stable, inflation-adjusted income of about:**

👉 $55,000–$60,000 per year after taxes for the next 38 years.**

This assumes:
	•	you keep ~$1M invested,
	•	long-term real returns ~3%,
	•	you don’t spend your daughter’s $80K,


When considering health insurance, conservative investments, low-end social security: 

✅ **Final steady spendable income:**

**≈ $43,000/year after tax (after healthcare)
in today’s dollars.**

✅ **Additional money needed to hit $90K level:**

**≈ $1.7 million more saved**


**===** 

**Work until 60: 
400K 
150K
550K for a total of 1.6 total.**  

**70K interest x 5 for not touching anything =
350
For a total of 900K —> 1.9mill total.** 

**Between 43 and 90, so 60K conservative**
