# Retire



**Great — thanks for the clarity.
Here is the complete answer based on the facts you already gave:** ***age 58 retiring*****,** ***kid age 9*****,** ***wife’s employer health insurance*****,** ***low Social Security estimate*****,** ***child Social Security benefits*****, and** ***$350k invested at 5%*****.

I’ll calculate:

→ How long your $350k lasts, given real-world reduced withdrawals starting at 62.

No more hypotheticals — here’s the full model.**

⸻

✅ **Your Financial Timeline & Withdrawal Needs

Below is what your withdrawal needs look like in a realistic scenario, given everything you shared.

Age 58 → 62 (4 years)**
	**•	No Social Security yet
	•	On wife’s employer insurance (big cost savings)
	•	You said earlier “I spend about $50k/yr” — we’ll use that
	•	Annual withdrawals needed: $50k**

**Age 62 → 67 (5 years)**
	**•	You take Social Security early with a low estimate:**
**Your SS at 62 (lowball): $1,500/month = $18,000/year**
	**•	Child receives 50% of your benefit (lowball too):**
**$750/month = $9,000/year**
	**•	Combined SS income: $27,000/year
	•	Your total needed spending: $50k
	•	Withdrawals needed from savings:**
**$50,000 – $27,000 = $23,000 per year**
	**•	Child benefits end when child turns 18 (around your age 67)**

**Age 67 → 65? → 70?

You start Medicare at 65, not 67, so let’s fix the sequence:

Age 62 → 65 (3 years)

You are on wife’s insurance still, not Medicare.

Withdrawals remain: $23k/year

Age 65 → 67 (2 years)**
	**•	You switch to Medicare
	•	New expenses: Medicare + supplemental ≈ $4k–$6k/yr
	•	But you are no longer paying employer premiums (your wife pays for you?).
We’ll assume this** ***roughly offsets*****.

So withdrawals stay about the same: $23k/year**

**Age 67**
	**•	Child turns 18
	•	Child SS stops
	•	Your income drops from $27k → $18k
	•	New withdrawal need:**
**$50k – $18k = $32k/year

We’ll model the money through all these stages.**

📊 **Calculation: How long your $350k lasts

We’ll step through your real withdrawal pattern:**

⸻

**Stage 1 — Age 58–62 (4 years withdrawing $50k/yr)

Investment returns: 5% annually

Year-by-year:**
	**•	Start: $350,000
	•	End of Year 1: $317,500
	•	End of Year 2: $282,375
	•	End of Year 3: $243,494
	•	End of Year 4: $200,669**

🔹 **Remaining at age 62: ≈ $200,700**

⸻

**Stage 2 — Age 62–65 (3 years withdrawing $23k/yr)**
	**•	End of Year 5: $187,403
	•	End of Year 6: $172,273
	•	End of Year 7: $155,136**

🔹 **Remaining at age 65: ≈ $155,100**

⸻

**Stage 3 — Age 65–67 (2 years withdrawing $23k/yr)**
	**•	End of Year 8: $139,893
	•	End of Year 9: $123,387**

🔹 **Remaining at age 67 (child benefit ends): ≈ $123,400**

⸻

**Stage 4 — Age 67+ (withdrawal jumps to $32k/yr)

Now the account is weaker but still earning 5%.

Let’s step through:

Age 67 → 68**
	**•	Balance: $123,387 → $97,557**

**Age 68 → 69**
	**•	Balance: $97,557 → $68,935**

**Age 69 → 70**
	**•	Balance: $68,935 → $37,381**

**Age 70 → 71**
	**•	Balance: $37,381 → $2,250**

**Age 71 → 72

You need another $32k, but you only have $2.2k left.
You run out early that year.**

⸻

🎉 **Final Result: How long your $350k lasts with all real factors included

Your $350k lasts until about age 71.2

≈ 13.2 years total

With all your real factors:**
	**•	Child Social Security
	•	Your early Social Security
	•	Wife’s employer insurance
	•	Medicare at 65
	•	Reduced withdrawals after 62

Your 350k lasts far longer than 9 years —
it lasts about 13 years.**

**Summary Table**

**Age**	**Withdrawal Needed**	**Balance at End**
**58 → 62**	**$50k/yr**	**~$200k**
**62 → 65**	**$23k/yr**	**~$155k**
**65 → 67**	**$23k/yr**	**~$123k**
**67 → 71.2**	**$32k/yr**	**$0**

**If you want, I can refine this easily:

Just tell me:**
	**•	Your ACTUAL Social Security estimated benefit at 62 (or FRA)
	•	Estimated spending (is $50k accurate?)
	•	If wife’s insurance costs anything additional when she adds you and the child

And I can give you a precise number down to the month.**
