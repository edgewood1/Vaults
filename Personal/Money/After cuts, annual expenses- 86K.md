# After cuts, annual expenses: 86K

# 


<u>**Scenario 1**</u>
2025 account
Joint: 500K
Mel: 180
Kathy: 120
Total: 700K

2030  (Mel = 60)
Kathy’s account grows by 150
Account: Assuming 8% growth, 700K could grow to 1 million by now. 
And 150K growing: 1.2 million
Assuming KP is making 46800/year
If Mel has 0 income, we would be -22K under

2036 account (KP = 60)
Assuming 4% growth, 
Account: After Mel’s deductions for 6 years: 1.4 million

Remainder
Assuming 4% interest, you would need 1.825 million to generate 73K per year before taxes.

Assuming tax deductions (22%) we would need 2.3 million.  

We would be 900K behind; while we would have enough, we would dip into the funds.  

<u>**Scenario 2**</u>: Mel works for 5 years


<u>**Scenario 3: 40K gifts for 5 years**</u>

<u>**Scenario 4 : Inheritance**</u>
