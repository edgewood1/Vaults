## **Potential downsides of rolling over to an IRA**
* Loss of access to 401(k) loan options: Some 401(k) plans allow you to borrow against your account balance, which can be useful in emergencies. This feature is not available with IRAs.
* Reduced creditor protection: While 401(k)s often enjoy strong creditor protection under federal law (ERISA), the protection for IRAs can vary by state,

* Potential for higher fees: While many IRAs offer lower-cost investment options, some may come with higher fees compared to a 401(k) depending on the brokerage and investments chosen. It's crucial to compare fee structures and investment options carefully.
* Delayed access to funds without penalty (Rule of 55): If you leave or lose your job in the year you turn 55 or later, you can often access your 401(k) funds penalty-free under the Rule of 55. However, this rule does not apply to IRAs, and you generally need to wait until age 59 ½ to avoid penalties on withdrawals.
* Less favorable tax treatment for appreciated employer stock (Net Unrealized Appreciation - NUA): If your 401(k) holds employer stock that has significantly appreciated, rolling it into an IRA could cause you to lose a potentially advantageous tax strategy called NUA,

## **Potential advantages of rolling over to an IRA**
* More investment choices: IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options, including individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds, compared to the limited options available in most 401(k) plans.
* Lower fees: You may be able to find an IRA provider with lower fees and expenses compared to your current 401(k).
* Easier consolidation and management: If you have multiple 401(k)s from different employers, rolling them into a single IRA can simplify your retirement savings management and tracking.
* Greater control and flexibility: With an IRA, you have more control over your investment decisions and can make adjustments as needed without being limited by your employer's plan administrator.
* Opportunity for Roth conversions: Rolling a traditional 401(k) to a traditional IRA leaves the option open to convert funds to a Roth IRA, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, although you would pay taxes on the conversion itself.
