# Retire


1459 at 62


**Based on your anticipated monthly Social Security benefit of $3,300 starting at age 70, let’s estimate the amount that would be deposited into your account in North Carolina after accounting for taxes and Medicare supplement plan premiums.

Tax Considerations:

In North Carolina, Social Security benefits are exempt from state income tax. However, they may be subject to federal income tax depending on your combined income, which includes your adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest, and half of your Social Security benefits. If your combined income exceeds certain thresholds, up to 85% of your Social Security benefits could be taxable at the federal level. Assuming you have no additional income, your combined income would be $1,650 (half of $3,300), which is below the federal taxation threshold for Social Security benefits. Therefore, in this scenario, your benefits would not be subject to federal income tax.

Medicare Supplement (Medigap) Plan Premiums:**


**Great — that detail helps a lot. If you’ll be 66 when your child turns 18, and you’re planning to collect Social Security at 62, then your child will be under 18 for about 4 years of your early retirement.**

**That means:**

⸻

✅ **You’re Eligible for a Dependent Child Benefit

Your minor child can receive up to 50% of your full retirement benefit (not the reduced amount at 62).

Assuming your Full Retirement Age (FRA) benefit is ~$2,100/month, your child may receive up to:**
	**•	$1,050/month (50% of your FRA benefit)
	•	For up to 4 years, until they turn 18
	•	Subject to the family maximum limit (usually 150–180% of your FRA benefit)**

🔁 **Updated Household Income Breakdown (Years 62–66)**

**Source**	**Monthly**	**Annual**
**Your SS (at 62)**	**$1,459**	**$17,508**
**Child benefit (est.)**	**~$1,050**	**~$12,600**
**401(k)/savings withdrawal**	**~$850**	**~$10,000**
**Total Income**	**$3,359**	**$40,108**

**You now need only ~$10,000/year from your savings to meet the $40K target.**

⸻

💵 **Tax Analysis (Married Filing Jointly with One Child)

Combined income:**
	**•	401(k): $10,000
	•	½ of your SS + child benefit: (17,508 + 12,600)/2 = $15,054
	•	Total combined income = $25,054

Still just under the $32,000 threshold for Social Security taxation.**

**Result:**
	**•	0% of Social Security taxable
	•	$10,000 taxable 401(k) income
	•	$30,000+ standard deduction (2025 est., joint)
	•	Tax liability = $0
	•	Child tax credit may provide additional refund**

🏥 **Medicare Costs (Once You Turn 65)

If you enroll in Medicare (after 65):**

**Deduction**	**Monthly**
**Part B**	**~$170**
**Medigap Plan G**	**~$135**
**Total Medicare Deduction**	**~$305**

**This comes out of your Social Security, not the child’s.**

## **Perfect — here’s a two-phase breakdown:**

⸻
## 
🔹 **Phase 1: Ages 62–66 (Child Under 18)**

**Source**	**Monthly**	**Annual**
**Your SS at 62**	**$1,459**	**$17,508**
**Child’s SS benefit**	**~$1,050**	**~$12,600**
**401(k)/Savings Withdrawal**	**~$850**	**~$10,000**
**Total Spendable Income**	**$3,359**	**$40,108**

**➤ Tax Summary:**
	**•	Combined income ≈ $25,000
	•	Standard deduction (married) ≈ $30,000
	•	Child tax credit: $2,000
	•	Federal taxes owed: $0
	•	Social Security not taxed
	•	Medicare deductions (after 65): $305/month from your benefit**

**➤ Net Monthly Deposits (Age 65):**

**Person**	**Net Deposit**
**You**	**~$1,154 (after Medicare)**
**Child**	**~$1,050**
**Total**	**~$2,200/month (until child turns 18)**


⸻
## 
🔹 **Phase 2: Age 66+ (After Child Turns 18)**

## **The child benefit ends. Spending goal remains $40,000/year. Your income shifts:**

**Post-child-income breakdown:**

**Source**	**Monthly**	**Annual**
**Your SS at 62**	**$1,459**	**$17,508**
**401(k)/Savings Withdrawal**	**~$1,875**	**~$22,492**
**Total Spendable Income**	**$3,334**	**$40,000**

**➤ Tax Summary:**
	**•	½ of SS = $8,754
	•	401(k) = $22,500
	•	Combined income = $31,254
	•	Still near the 50% SS tax threshold
→ Estimate: ~$4,000 of SS taxable
	•	Taxable income ≈ $26,500
	•	After standard deduction (~$30K), still $0–$200 tax liability

The loss of the child tax credit is offset by low taxable income, so you still owe little to no tax.**

💡 **Overall Projection Summary**

**Phase**	**Total SS Income**	**401(k) Need**	**Net Monthly Deposit**	**Taxes**
**62–66 (with child)**	**~$30,108/year**	**~$10,000**	**~$2,200/month**	**$0**
**66+ (no child)**	**~$17,508/year**	**~$22,500**	**~$1,154/month (SS) + withdrawals**	**~$0–$200**


⸻

**Yes — based on your plan:**
	**•	Withdraw $10K/year until your child turns 18 (age 66 for you)
	•	Then withdraw $22K/year afterward
	•	You have $500,000 in savings (401k + cash)
	•	You expect occasional medical emergencies

Let’s break this down into three parts:**

⸻

🔹 **1. Basic Longevity Estimate (No Investment Growth, Adjusted for Emergencies)

Assumptions:**
	**•	Start at age 62
	•	$10K/year withdrawal for 4 years (ages 62–66)
	•	$22K/year starting at age 66
	•	Medical emergencies cost ~$5,000 every 5 years (average $1K/year)
	•	So total average withdrawal = $23K/year after 66**

📉 **Calculation:**
	**•	First 4 years: $10K × 4 = $40K
	•	Remaining funds: $500K – $40K = $460K
	•	Ongoing draw: ~$23K/year from 66 onward

Now divide:
	•	$460K ÷ $23K/year ≈ 20 years**

➡️ **Your savings would last:
	•	4 years (low withdrawal) +
	•	~20 years (post-child) = ~24 years total**

🕰️ **So your money would last until:**
	**•	Age 62 + 24 = Age 86**

⸻

🔹 **2. With 3% Annual Investment Return

If your portfolio earns a modest 3% real return after inflation:**
	**•	You’d likely stretch your funds to about age 90–92
	•	Medical costs are still factored in
	•	This assumes stable withdrawals and no long-term care costs**

⸻

🔹 **3. What Could Shorten or Extend It

Could shorten:**
	**•	More frequent or major medical events
	•	Inflation outpacing your investment returns
	•	Needing to help your child with college or other support
	•	Adding in your wife’s Medicare + healthcare costs if not budgeted yet**

**Could extend:**
	**•	Delaying your wife’s Social Security to maximize her benefit
	•	Downsizing or reducing expenses after child leaves
	•	Earning part-time income (even modest) to reduce draw
	•	Getting solid returns (4–5%) with low fees and risk**

⸻

✅ **Summary**

**Scenario**	**Money Lasts Until**
**No investment growth, modest emergencies**	**~Age 86**
**With 3% return**	**~Age 90–92**
**Higher medical needs or inflation**	**Could be earlier**
**Reduced expenses or part-time work**	**Could extend beyond 92**


⸻

**Great clarification — if you want to withdraw a fixed amount like $2,000 per month until your money runs out, you want a drawdown plan with guaranteed fixed payouts, and there are two main ways to do this:**

⸻

✅ **1. Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) – With Fixed Amounts

This is the simplest and most flexible solution:**
	**•	You tell your brokerage (like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab):
“Send me $2,000/month from this account until the funds are gone.”
	•	You can choose:**
	**•	Fixed dollar amount ($2,000/month)
	•	Start date (e.g., at age 62)
	•	Frequency (monthly, quarterly)**
	**•	You stay invested, so your balance shrinks slower if the market grows, and faster if markets drop.
	•	There’s no guarantee it lasts forever, but you control the account.
	•	You can stop, adjust, or pause the withdrawals anytime.

This is what most retirees use who want flexibility and control but still want regular income.**

**➤ Example:**
	**•	$500,000 balance
	•	Withdraw $2,000/month = $24,000/year
	•	Assuming 3% annual growth → money lasts about 25 years
	•	Without investment growth → money lasts ~20.8 years**

⸻

🔒 **2. Period Certain Annuity (Fixed-Term Annuity)

This is more rigid but provides contractual guarantees:**
	**•	You give an insurance company your $500K
	•	They guarantee $2,000/month for 20.8 years (or a similar term)
	•	If you die early, payments can continue to a beneficiary (depending on how it’s structured)
	•	No investment risk — but you lose access to the principal
	•	Payments don’t adjust for inflation unless you pay extra

Good if you’re risk-averse, want zero management, and don’t need flexibility.**

⸻

🧠 **Summary Comparison**

**Feature**	**SWP (Brokerage)**	**Fixed-Term Annuity**
**Control over funds**	✅ **Full control**	❌ **No access after purchase**
**Fixed $2K/month possible**	✅ **Yes**	✅ **Yes**
**Market growth helps**	✅ **Yes**	❌ **No**
**Stops when funds run out**	✅ **Yes (self-managed)**	✅ **Yes (term-based)**
**Flexibility to adjust**	✅ **Yes**	❌ **No**
**Inflation protection**	✅ **Optional via growth**	❌ **Usually not included**
**Guarantees (no market risk)**	❌ **No**	✅ **Yes**


⸻

✅ **Recommended for You:

Use a Systematic Withdrawal Plan at a brokerage (like Vanguard or Fidelity).
Set it up to draw $2,000/month from your balanced portfolio.
Track annually to make sure returns are supporting the pace of withdrawal.**
