DPD
Contact DPD about the warning system, address file, DPD contact. Learn more about the Durham County Misdemeaner Diversion Program

* <u>**Clarify Warning System**</u>**:** Determine how DPD issues and tracks warnings for noise violations:
	* Is it per incident?
	* Is it tied to a specific address (or duplex)?
	* Is it tied to specific individuals (allowing different people to receive separate warnings)?
* **Check for Address File:** Inquire if DPD maintains a specific incident file or log for the problem property address.
* <u>**Establish DPD Contact**</u>**:** Explore the possibility of having a regular contact person within DPD (e.g., Community Resource Officer, District representative) who can provide updates on the status of the address file and any enforcement actions taken (warnings issued, referrals to diversion, citations).
* **Refine Police Call Procedure:** When calling DPD for future incidents:
	* Provide your name.
	* Request a callback from the responding officer or relevant personnel.
	* Follow up later (through established contact, if possible) regarding the outcome or consequences of the call.
