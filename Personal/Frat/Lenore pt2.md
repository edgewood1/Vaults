# Lenore pt2


- 1030, party buses pull up and 20-40 kids load in who have been drinking.  They are loud. 
- The buses drop them off around 130-200 and they linger in the street, talking loudly, waiting for Ubers.  The sounds of doors slamming, cars roaring off, and loud talk is on the street for 30-60 minutes.
- Wakes our dog and child and us. 
- We have sound machines and air filters running, and have invested in sound-proof windows, but the noise pierces all that. 
- Our neighbors are selling their house and moving.   The fraternity is half the reason they are doing so.
