# Fraternity



Can you help me write an informal email to Elinor.  

she met with chapter presidents a couple weeks ago, and I was wondering if she learned anything from that, as in, is the group across the street representing a different fraternity than last year, and whether her previous emails attempts had actually gotten to the landlord, who has made some changes regarding tenant quality, and whether she thinks those changes might stick with future rotations.  

I also wanted to convey that across the street, there has hardly been a peep, and there are also half as many cars parked out front as in previous years, so I’m guessing there are fewer students.  

Lastly, at teh last meeting with Alisa, she suggested I write a letter to city council.  I don’t have a current complaint with the current folks across the street and don’t want to imply this, but I could convey that examples from last year, and how that made the street chaotic.  I wonder if there’s something specific we could mention as a request - that might help Elinor do her job better - wit regard to other problem streets, or even our own, were it to return to the way things were. What would we be asking for? 
What is an easy change that would help Elinor do her job better? 

1. Alisa wants me to write city council
2. Use the example from last year email to Elinor
3. But don’t want to complain about the current state because they seem to have changed
4. What would we be asking for? 
5. What is an easy change that would help Elinor do her job better? 
6. What neighborhoods are struggling in light of that?
