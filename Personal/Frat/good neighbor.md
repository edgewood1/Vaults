# good neighbor



Hey, 
1. We have a fraternity
2. Handout 1 are the rules they should abide by
3. Handout 2 is what to do if they break the rules
4. Rationale handout2: 
	1. Duke needs data (police report) to support our claims (email to Elinor) to enact change. 
	2. No one gets into trouble; but action is take to increase awareness.
	3. Goal: lower our need to call public safety agencies. 

1. Elinor has 200 fund for a social.  Quarterly? 

Elinor, 
1. Did you say there was a 200 fund for socials? 
2. I’m assuming the police reports work as data for the email-claims.  Is there an alternative to calling the police? We believed
3. **We want to advocate for the students, since holding animosity towards them can have negative mental health effects which we’ve noticed with a few neighbors.** 
4. **The heart of Have a HEART Durham’s mission is mental health & behavioral crisis support—not noise or nuisance enforcement.**
5. That said, there 
6. *could* be room to advocate for broader quality-of-life concerns under a more expansive model of unarmed, compassionate response. If noise issues are leading to mental distress or involve vulnerable individuals, those cases might align with HEART’s spirit—but they’re not its current operational scope.
8. Would you like help exploring or connecting HEART with broader community response strategies that might include noise concerns or other neighborhood issues?


The term "Good Neighbor Policy" in the context of Durham, NC, most likely refers to the Duke Good Neighbor Program, which **aims to foster positive relationships between Duke University and the surrounding Durham community**. This program focuses on communication, collaboration, and addressing the needs of the community, particularly in neighborhoods near Duke's campus.

## **Here's a more detailed explanation:** 
* **Focus on Collaboration:** The Duke Good Neighbor Program is a collaborative effort involving various Duke offices (Student Affairs, Community Affairs), Duke student government, and Durham community organizations. [<u>[1](https://students.duke.edu/living/housing/graduate-professional-housing/housing-in-durham/duke-good-neighbor-program/#:~:text=The%20Duke%20Good%20Neighbor%20Program%20is%20run,Police%2C%20Durham%20Police%2C%20and%20Durham%20Neighborhoods%20United.)</u>, <u>[2](https://community.duke.edu/program/duke-durham-neighborhood-partnership/)</u>] 
* **Community Engagement:** The program works with specific Durham neighborhoods, initially focusing on those closest to Duke's East and West campuses, and has expanded to include others. [<u>[2](https://community.duke.edu/program/duke-durham-neighborhood-partnership/)</u>] 
* **Addressing Needs:** It aims to identify and address community needs through data-driven approaches, focusing on reducing interactions with public safety agencies while improving outcomes for residents, particularly those with complex needs. [<u>[2](https://community.duke.edu/program/duke-durham-neighborhood-partnership/)</u>, <u>[3](https://durham.clearpointstrategy.com/create-a-safer-community-together/reduce-public-safety-interactions-with-and-improve-outcomes-for-familiar-neighbors/)</u>] 
* **Historical Context:** The program builds on the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, which was established in 1996 to facilitate communication and connection between Duke and the surrounding neighborhoods. [<u>[2](https://community.duke.edu/program/duke-durham-neighborhood-partnership/)</u>] 
* **"Familiar Neighbors" Concept:** The program identifies "familiar neighbors" – individuals with frequent interactions with public safety agencies – and develops person-centered strategies to address their needs and reduce reliance on those services, according to ClearPoint Strategy. [<u>[3](https://durham.clearpointstrategy.com/create-a-safer-community-together/reduce-public-safety-interactions-with-and-improve-outcomes-for-familiar-neighbors/)</u>] 
* **Data-Driven Approach:** The program utilizes data analysis to understand patterns of interaction with public safety agencies and tailor interventions accordingly. [<u>[3](https://durham.clearpointstrategy.com/create-a-safer-community-together/reduce-public-safety-interactions-with-and-improve-outcomes-for-familiar-neighbors/)</u>] 
* **Beyond Public Safety:** The program recognizes that addressing the needs of "familiar neighbors" requires collaboration beyond traditional public safety agencies, extending to health and social service agencies.
