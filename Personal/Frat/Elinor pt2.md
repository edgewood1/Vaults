# Elinor pt2


We did like your response, but to give additional context, we are providing our original letter, and Lenore’s response.  After it is a brainstorm response.   Can you organize the brainstorm into a proper response that is respectful yet clear.  We do re-mention the  Ubers, so this could be mentioned again in our 2nd response, but if it is, it should be in a way that doesn’t merely reiterate - she is likely partially aware of the isssue from teh first letter. 

The original letter:

Dear Lenore,
We are residents of Duke Park, and your Good Neighbor Program flyer was recently shared with our listserv. We appreciate your focus on the important issue of Duke students living in our community. We are writing to bring to your attention a specific situation involving a Duke business school fraternity occupying four 3-bedroom apartments at 411-415 W Markham Avenue. This property was reportedly initially purchased by Devon Solow, a member of the group. For the past three to four years, there has been a constant turnover of residents, and none of the groups have adhered to the standards outlined in your flyer. We greatly miss the quiet character of our street before the fraternity moved in.
While their parties are infrequent, they are large and disruptive, particularly in their aftermath. Our primary concern is the noise created by large groups of people leaving these parties between 12:00 AM and 2:00 AM, often on weeknights as well as weekends. These individuals congregate on the street while waiting for Ubers, creating a steady stream of traffic, slamming car doors, and shouting to one another. The use of rented party buses, often with loud music, further exacerbates traffic congestion. As a working family raising a child, we have tried various measures to mitigate the noise, including earplugs, sound machines, and soundproof windows, but we still experience significant sleep disruption. We know that not all families on our street have been able to implement such measures.
A secondary concern is the consistent disregard for their property and the resulting accumulation of trash. Although the residents have multiple city trash cans, these are quickly overwhelmed and often left on the street. Even with the provided cans, additional bags of trash are often left in the storage areas, and debris litters both their yard and the street. Around graduation time, the accumulation of trash becomes particularly severe, forming a large mound that remains for weeks until a dumpster is finally brought in.
We urge the city and Duke to consider implementing stricter regulations to address these issues.
Kind regards,
Kathy & Mel

Hi Kathy and Mel,

Thank you for bringing these addresses to my attention. 

On behalf of the university, I apologize for these disruptions. I have a few follow up questions if you don't mind:
* To clarify, are the addresses 411, 413, and 415 W Markham? I believe I'm missing the fourth.
* Do you know if any of your neighbors or you have called the police (911 or non-emergency number) concerning any of these houses this year? I know that someone did at least once last year, but I haven't heard anything from DPD or Duke PD this year. 
* Can you think of the most recent date of one of these disruptive parties? No worries if not.
* Is your understanding that these are undergraduate students who are in the business fraternity?
* Have y'all been in touch with the property owner, Devon Solow?
A bit of insight about our process:
* As you saw in the flyer, we treat emails like this from neighbors the same way we would a police report. However, having a police report is helpful as an additional tool in our student conduct process.
* Generally, we will follow up with the students who live at each address and bring them into the student conduct process.
* Something else I've also pursued with other properties is following up with the property owner or management company to bring them in as a partner.
Please keep me posted if you experience further disturbances at these properties. If it's easier, feel free to call my direct line, 919-684-3608. I will be following up this week.

Elinor

These are duplexes registered at 411 and 415.  There is no 413.  

We don’t know about others, but we haven’t called the police this year. 

Having 15 uber cars out front waiting as students run up and down the streets, some screaming, others waiting in conversation.  Car doors slamming .  Some of these cars have music blaring.  At the peak, it’s 15 cars before dies down.   After midnight, these sounds carry.  

The disturbances are intermittent.  
There’s well over 30 people to draw in so many Ubers. These are people leaving the party, not including those who live there and are spending the night.  

The last party was Saturday night.  These parties are pretty regular, so much so that one neighbor caught an uber home, and the driver was familiar with the address, calling the 411 and 415 the “party house”. 

With this intermenent aspect, it’s hard to call the police, especially if it’s late.  We’re sensitive to the work Durham police already have to endure. 

These students are definitely undergraduates.  We know that they are a fraternity because they once had Greek symbols on flags in their back yard, and because of the nature of their gatherings.  Also, sororities visit.   We also know the initial owner, Devon Solow, was in the fraternity, and upon graduation bought the property and rented to these members to ensure occupancy.   Solow was apathetic when other neighbors tried to discuss the matter with him.  Last year he sold the property to ___.  

I think most neighbors are trying to adapt to these folks and in order to avoid problems, they don’t want to involve the police, or deal with potential backlash. 



The entire neighborhood is aware of this address as a general eyesore and nuisance. 

A block further down, there are duke students who live there, but they don’t have the same gatherings.
