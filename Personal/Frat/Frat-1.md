**Taking on the ivory tower**
Baker’s focus on land use extends beyond the City Council. 
Last fall, he helped launch the Duke Respect Durham campaign, an initiative that asks the university to pay $50 million each year to the Bull City. You’ve seen the yard signs: Navy blue with bright yellow letters and the image of a bull, they line the residential streets around Duke’s  campus. 
Like many private universities, Duke is a nonprofit and largely exempt from property taxes. The school is also Durham’s largest and wealthiest private landowner, with an $11.9 billion endowment and land holdings worth more than <u>[$787 million](https://www.theassemblync.com/education/higher-education/duke-respect-durham/#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20Duke's%20property,by%20more%20than%20%24100%20million.)</u>. 
As the university prospers, organizers say the town-gown relationship is lopsided. They point to peer institutions like Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth, which make voluntary payments to their home cities each year in lieu of taxes, called PILOT agreements. 
“It’s past time that Duke University strengthened its partnership with the people of Durham, that it does what’s right, and that it begins to make reasonable payments to our local governments and to the collective good,” Baker said at the group’s launch event in September. He said he hopes to bring representatives from the campaign, city, county and university together to discuss a PILOT plan. 
“It’s a land justice issue, it’s a tax justice issue, it’s so much wrapped into one thing,” Baker said in an interview
