Subject: Re: Concerns Regarding Student Housing at 411-415 W Markham Avenue
Dear Elinor,
Thank you for your prompt response and offer to assist with this matter. We appreciate your attention to these concerns.
To answer your questions and provide further context from our initial letter:
* The addresses in question are 411 and 415 W Markham; these are duplexes. There is no 413. The current owners are Hilda and Louis Ntasin, under the entity MAYWOOD STREET APARTMENTS LLC, located at <u>[7229 Meadow Run Ln, Charlotte, NC 28277](https://www.google.com/maps/search/7229+Meadow+Run+Ln,+Charlotte,+NC+28277?entry=gmail&source=g)</u>.   This is a new owner as of last summer.  The previous owner was a local business person.

Status
* **Inferred**
* While we cannot speak for other neighbors, we personally have not called the police this year. We understand that at least one call was made last year.
* The most recent party occurred this past Saturday night. As mentioned in our initial letter, these parties are intermittent and can be disruptive, particularly in the late-night hours as people depart. This frequency is such that a neighbor recently had an Uber driver who was already familiar with 411 and 415, referring to them as the “party house.” This speaks to the ongoing nature of the problem.
* As we described before, the disturbances are primarily caused by the large number of people leaving the parties late at night, creating significant noise from conversations, shouting, slamming car doors, and sometimes loud music from Ubers, which line the street in both directions causing traffic issues.  
* We have hesitated to call the police for several reasons. The pickup situation, while consistently disruptive, varies in intensity throughout the night and the week. The noise is often intermittent; for example, a period of loud conversation or yelling might last only 10 minutes or so and then subside once a ride departs. By the time the police might arrive, the situation may have calmed down, making it difficult for them to witness the disturbance firsthand. This makes us question what effective action the police could take even if they were called. We are also aware of the demands on the Durham Police Department and are reluctant to add to their workload if it seems unlikely to resolve the core issue. Additionally, we believe many neighbors are trying to adapt to the situation to avoid conflict or potential backlash. However, the issue is widely known within the neighborhood and on the list-serve, with these addresses recognized as a consistent nuisance and eyesore.
* We are confident these are undergraduate students and members of a fraternity.
As we stated in our initial letter, these are not isolated incidents but a recurring issue that significantly affects the quality of life in our neighborhood. While other Duke student residences a block away do not generate similar complaints, these particular addresses have become a consistent source of disruption.
We appreciate your offer to follow up and are hopeful that a productive solution can be found. Please let us know if you require any further information.
Kind regards,
Kathy & Mel
