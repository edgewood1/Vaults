Here’s a cleaned-up, easier-to-read revision of your message while keeping the tone friendly but clear:

**Subject:** Follow-Up on Flyer Feedback

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the feedback on the flyer and for sharing the ones from your office!

I spoke with some neighbors, and a few common concerns came up:
	1.	**Large backyard gatherings** – Sometimes big groups gather to watch sporting events or hold ceremonies. Even when these happen on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, cheering can go on for hours.
	2.	**Late-night street noise** – Students lingering in the street while waiting for Ubers can be disruptive late at night.

These issues seem avoidable. Celebrations involving loud cheering could be held indoors, and alternative locations could be chosen for large gatherings.

Neighbors find these moments both amusing and, over time, disruptive. Everyone seemed aware that most of the noise comes from visitors rather than residents.

With Suzy gone, I suspect you may hear fewer complaints about the fraternity—especially since there’s a general reluctance to call the police for casual disturbances. However, fewer calls may not always mean improved behavior, so it would be helpful if students could get regular reminders about noise expectations throughout the semester, not just at the start.

Kathy and I would be happy to join any visits.

One question: What’s required before students recieve a “corrective action” plan (university discipline)? Does it take a certain number of police calls to the address, or do emails to you also count?

Thanks,
Mel & Kathy

If you’d like, I can also make a **slightly warmer and less formal version** so it reads even more conversational but stays organized. That might make it more approachable for the reader. Would you like me to do that?

This is an email Elinor has sent us: 

Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear that Anu and Suzy moved. I hope it wasn't entirely because of the students across the street, though I know they had a hard time.

The flyer you sent looks great. Accurate information and helpful to distribute widely.

We'll be handing out a similar one on August 25 during our annual (this is only the 2nd year we've done it) Duke Good Neighbor Program "knock and talk" event. We have a flyer for the students, linked here, and one for residents in neighborhoods like y'all's, linked here. 


Please do stay in touch as the school year begins. In addition to the regular visit from the Good Neighbor event in August, some colleagues from Duke and I will be doing additional outreach to the houses on your block, and a few other houses scattered across the city that have been more disruptive in the last couple of years. We want to make sure these houses learn early about our expectations of them.

If you would like to be involved in one of these visits, please let me know. I can facilitate a conversation to help the students start off the year on better footing. Totally not necessary, but I've had this request from some neighbors in the past so want to offer it to y'all as well.

Let me know,
 
My response: 

Hey, thanks for the feedback on the flyer and for sharing the ones from your office!

I spoke with some neighbors, and the main issues are loud, extended cheering during sporting events watched outdoors, and late-night noise from Ubers (conversations and car doors slamming). It's often amusing, but also quite disruptive.

Just a heads-up, neighbors are often reluctant to call the police for casual disturbances, so a lack of calls might not always indicate improved behavior. It would be really helpful if students could receive reminders about noise expectations throughout the semester, not just at the start.
Kathy and I would be happy to join any visits, whether in our neighborhood or others.


Since you have some context, can you compose a similar letter to our neighbor? 

Welcome to the neighborhood.  One thing you might not be aware of is that the every fall, a fraternity, mostly seniors, occupies the duplexes across the street until graduation.  In the past, they have caused disturbances due to party busses collecting students and dropping them off on our street.  Typically, the issue is wiht friends of the residents rather than the residents themselves.  However, there is recourse - we are in touch with Elinor, who is director of off-campus & community life at Duke, and Alisa, who runs Durham Neighborhoods United.  There’s not a lot we can do but just remind the students about the good neighbor policy, and email Elinor about any concerns etc.  A police call is also an option, as the report gets sent to Elinor’s office and gives her evidence for taking action and getting Duke more involved.   Most neighbors finding them someone annoying but I think maintaining positivity aroudn the situation and initiating dialogue with Duke and the community is the healthiest approach.

Neighbors: 

Of course! It's smart to want to get the tone just right, especially for a first impression. Let's work on making this letter as friendly and helpful as possible.
You've already got all the key information down. We just need to put it together in a way that feels warm and welcoming.
Here is a revised draft of the letter. I've focused on keeping it concise and positive, and I've tried to structure it so it's easy to read.

Hey Sarah and John, 

Welcome to the neighborhood! We're so happy you're here.

We wanted to give you a heads-up about the duplexes across the street.  They are occupied by a fraternity, with the students moving in soon for the school year. 

The main issues in the past have typically been with friends of the residents, particularly when party buses and Ubers come to our street for pickups and drop-offs.

We wanted to let you know that we have recourse—we're in touch with Elinor, the director of off-campus & community life at Duke, and Alisa, who runs Durham Neighborhoods United.

As issues occur, we’re welcome to share concerns with the students, but another approach is to email Elinor with details about the issue.  She prefers our sending photos or videos, but if that seems excessive, she suggests calling the police, as that report gets sent to her office and provides the evidence needed for Duke to get more involved (see attachment).

Regardless, Elinor’s office intends to regularly check in with the students over the course of the year. 

We’d be glad to chat more about this, and we’ll keep you posted.  

Let us know if you need anything as you get settled. 

Best,
Mel and Kathy
