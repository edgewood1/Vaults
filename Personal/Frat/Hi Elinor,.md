# Hi Elinor,

# 

Great to see you Monday.  

Tuesday afternoon, Alex, one of the fraternity brothers, visited us and gave us a card + treats.  The card gave an introduction, his name, and contact phone number. 

He had a rehearsed speech for us, which he was a little nervous about, but he did great.  He seemed sincere.  We asked him some questions, and he said that his landlord insisted upon the visits, and that they were part of a new “group”.  When we asked him what this meant, it wasn’t clear if this was a new group in the old frat or a new frat.  Kathy said he implied it was a new frat.  

he was also aware of the problems caused by the last group and that they didn’t want to repeat those issues.  

Hi Elinor,

It was great to see you on Monday.

I wanted to update you on a visit we had on Tuesday afternoon. A fraternity brother named Alex from apartment 413 stopped by with a card and some treats. He seemed a little nervous as he delivered a rehearsed speech, but afterwards, he relaxed as we asked him some questions. 

He said he was part of a new “group”, and by “new group”,  it wasn't clear if he meant a new group within the existing fraternity or a completely new fraternity. Kathy thinks he implied it was a new fraternity. 

Alex also said that one of the four apartments, I think 415, is not currently rented, which explains the fewer number of cars out front. 

He was also aware of the problems caused by the previous group and said they don't want to repeat them.

He also said the landlord insisted he make this visit.  Since we didn’t contact the landlord, we can assume your contact with them has led to this positive effect.  In the future, it would be helpful if the landlord's office could eventually share the names and fraternity affiliations of the new residents with you.

So far, the noise has been manageable, but the trash has gotten worse.  We’re guess the trash is related to their move-in .  If it doesn't improve, I'll likely text Alex the contact information for someone I know who can pick it up for around $100.
