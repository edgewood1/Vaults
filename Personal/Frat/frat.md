# frat



Hey Carol, 

I talked to my neighbor, Suzie, yesterday.  She and her partner bought Christine’s old house.  She had noise concerns regarding the fraternity that occupies the duplex across the street, and has recently been in frequent communication with Elinor Landess, the Assistant Dean of Students who also happens to be the Director of Off Campus & Community Life (I’ve been in touch with Elinor as well, but not as much as Suzie). 

I’m trying to support them as I can through the process, and she wondered if there was some role DPNA, a city entity, or the media could play?  Any thoughts would be good, and would be glad to discuss in person or over phone.  I know y’all might be on vacation, so this could easily wait until after you’ve returned and settled down. 

They might try to attend the next DPNA meeting. 

Thanks!
Mel

This suggests that Ward 4 is represented by one of the At-Large Council Members—Nate Baker, Javiera Caballero, or Carl Rist—who serve the entire city rather than a specific ward
