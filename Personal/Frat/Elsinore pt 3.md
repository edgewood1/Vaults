Subject: Re: Concerns Regarding Student Housing at 411-415 W Markham Avenue
Dear Elinor,
Thank you for your prompt response and offer to assist with this matter. We appreciate your attention to these concerns.
To answer your questions:
* The addresses in question are 411 and 415 W Markham. These are duplexes; there is no 413. The current owners are Hilda and Louis Ntasin, under the entity MAYWOOD STREET APARTMENTS LLC, located at 7229 Meadow Run Ln, Charlotte, NC 28277.
* While we cannot speak for other neighbors, we personally have not called the police this year. We understand that at least one call was made last year.
* The most recent party occurred this past Saturday night. These parties are frequent enough that one of our neighbors recently used an Uber and the driver was already familiar with 411 and 415, referring to them as the “party house.”
* The disturbances typically involve a large number of people leaving the parties between midnight and later, resulting in significant noise from conversations, shouting, slamming car doors, and sometimes loud music from the Ubers themselves. At peak times, we've observed as many as 15 Uber vehicles waiting outside. This noise carries significantly late at night. The number of Ubers suggests a gathering of well over 30 people, not including those residing at the property.
* We have hesitated to call the police due to the intermittent nature of the disturbances and our awareness of the demands on the Durham Police Department. We also believe many neighbors are trying to adapt to the situation to avoid conflict or potential backlash. However, the issue is widely known within the neighborhood, with these addresses recognized as a consistent nuisance and eyesore.
* We are confident these are undergraduate students and members of a fraternity. This is based on several observations: the presence of Greek symbols on flags in their backyard in the past, the nature of their gatherings, visits from sororities, and our knowledge that the initial owner, Devon Solow (who was himself a member of the fraternity), purchased the property upon graduation and rented it to fraternity members. Mr. Solow was unresponsive to previous attempts by neighbors to address these concerns. He has since sold the property to the current owners listed above.
We want to emphasize that the disturbances are not isolated incidents but a recurring issue that affects the entire neighborhood. While other Duke student residences a block away do not generate similar complaints, these particular addresses have become a consistent source of disruption.
We appreciate your offer to follow up and are hopeful that a productive solution can be found. Please let us know if you require any further information.
Kind regards,
Kathy & Mel
