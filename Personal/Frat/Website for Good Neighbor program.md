# Lenore (Noise & Trash - where is her contact info)

Three years ago, a man bought the 2 duplexes across the street, and has rented them out to approximate 12 fraternity boys.  The landlord is a Duke grad and was once in frat.  Each year, there’s a new cohort of boys, so there’s a disconnect from year to year, with the repeated violations due to an inability to learn from the previous year’s lessons. 

Initially, their presence frustrated many neighbors due to the size of their parties and the litter they left behind.  They also use the houses as a meeting point before taking busses down town, then congregate again at 2am where everyone takes Ubers home. While these parties have toned down, they predictably occur at key points at the semester.   Neighbors have attempted to discuss the issue with them, but they are dismissive, due to their being inebriated.  Neighbors have also called the police due to the noise, as well as the illegal partying that occurs (their friends block in residents so that the residents can not pull out and make it to work in the morning). 

The biggest complain has been the way they handle their trash.  They produce a great deal, far too much for the city trucks to haul, and often leave a large stack outside their apartments for 2-3 weeks until the landlord finally hires someone to pick it up due to several complaints from neighbors to the city. 

I just want to alert you to their presence. 

We appreciate the list of points you sent out, count you add the trash / beautification question to it? 

Is there any way your office could communicate regular to these students.  I’m uncertain that a sending out a newsletter is very effective - it’s possible that they don’t get it, toss it, etc. 

Ideally, we’d like to see this land lord rent out to more diverse crowd (not just a fraternity) - grad students, for example, or non-Duke professionals.  Ultimately, we’r ehopfule that the city and Duke could pass more stringent laws about this recurrent behavior that seems to fragment a sense of community, trash the street.

## Revised Complaint/Request Letter to Head of Community Relations Department

**Dear [Head of Department Name],**

I am writing to you today to express my concerns about the ongoing issues caused by a group of students residing at [address of duplexes]. Since their arrival three years ago, there have been repeated problems with noise, disruptive behavior, littering, and improper waste disposal.

**Specific Concerns:**

* **Large number of occupants:** Approximately 12 fraternity members reside in the duplexes, exceeding recommended occupancy limits and contributing to noise disturbances.
* **Frequent parties:** While the frequency has decreased, large gatherings still occur predictably during certain periods, causing noise and disruption to the neighborhood.
* **Disrespectful behavior:** Attempts by neighbors to address issues directly have been met with dismissive and disrespectful responses from the students, often due to intoxication.
* **Illegal activities:** Residents have blocked driveways, preventing neighbors from leaving for work. Additionally, there have been instances of underage drinking and other illegal activities.
* **Excessive trash accumulation:** The residents generate a significant amount of garbage, often leaving large piles outside for weeks before it is disposed of. This creates an unsightly and unsanitary situation.

**Desired Outcomes:**

* **Improved communication:** We request your department to establish a regular communication channel with the residents, addressing their responsibilities and expectations for respectful behavior within the community. A simple newsletter may not be the most effective method; exploring alternative options like direct outreach or community dialogues could be beneficial.
* **Tenant diversification:** We would appreciate exploring options to encourage the landlord to rent to a more diverse group of tenants, such as graduate students or professionals, who better align with the values and demographics of the surrounding community.
* **Strengthened regulations:** We urge the city and Duke to consider stricter regulations addressing issues of excessive noise, disruptive behavior, and improper waste disposal in multi-occupancy dwellings. This would help create a more harmonious and responsible living environment for all residents.

**Moving Forward:**

We appreciate your department's efforts to foster positive relationships between the school and the community. We believe by addressing these concerns collaboratively, we can create a more peaceful and respectful environment for everyone.

We are available to discuss these issues further and work towards solutions. Please feel free to contact us at [your contact information].

Sincerely,

[Your Name(s)]

**Additional Notes:**

* This revised letter focuses on specifics instead of generalities, providing examples and concrete details to support your claims.
* It outlines clear desired outcomes, suggesting possible solutions while remaining respectful and collaborative in tone.
* It avoids making discriminatory statements about fraternity members, focusing on specific behaviors and actions.
* It concludes with a call to action and provides your contact information for further communication.

I hope this revised letter is helpful! Please feel free to adjust it further based on your specific needs and preferences.

## Revised Complaint/Request Letter to Head of Community Relations Department

Devon Solow 357-6883

**Final Draft**

Dear Elinor Landess

I am writing to share the situation about the 12+ fraternity students residing at 411-415 W. Markham Ave.  Since their arrival three years ago, there have been problems with noise, disruptive behavior, littering, and improper waste disposal that have impacted the peace and livability of our neighborhood.

The large numbers of people living on that lot inevitably leads to increased noise levels, particularly during gatherings and parties. While the frequency of these events appear to have decreased, they still predictably occur at key points during the semester, disturbing the surrounding residents.  Neighbor who have tried to talk to them about the issue have had little luck in seeing change. 

Unfortunately, the problems extend beyond noise. Residents have been forced to endure blocked driveways, preventing them from leaving for work.  There have been instances of puke in trash cans, party debris along the street, and underage drinking. 

The biggest issue is the overwhelming volume of trash generated by the occupants. Especially towards the end of the semester, large piles accumulate outside the duplexes for weeks before being addressed, creating an unsightly and unsanitary environment that detracts from the overall ambiance of the neighborhood. 

Given these issues, we would appreciate your department's intervention in establishing a consistent and effective communication channel with the residents. While a flyer may be one method, another approach would be direct outreach to the students or the landlord, Devon Solow, who appears to be a former Duke student and fraternity member.  His number is 357-6883.  It would also be good if the students clearly understood the impact they have on the street, which includes a number of young children.   

Finally, we urge the city and Duke to consider implementing stricter regulations that address these problems.  Your recent Good Neighbor Program flyer does suggest that students keep the noise down, and we hope you can make mention of the trash issue as well. 

We appreciate your department's dedication to fostering positive relationships between the school and the community. 

Sincerely,

Mel DeJesus and Kathy Parry 
416 W. Markham


**January 2025 New Draft**
Main complaints: 
- the noise and traffic and street debris that comes with the before/aftermath of their massive parties
- The general disregard of their property - trash piles up, city cans are not brought back from street, 

Hi Lenore

We are residents of Duke Park, and someone forwarded your Good Neighbor Program flyer to our listserv. We appreciate you making the issue of Duke students living in the community a high priority. We’d like to bring your attention to a Duke business school fraternity who rent 4 3-bedroom apartments on 411-415 W Markham Avenue. The rental property was initial purchased by Devon Solow, who is said to be a member of this group.  There has been a steady rotation for 3-4 years now, and none of the cohorts have upheld any of the standards listed on the flyer. We very much miss how our street was before the fraternity moved in. 

While their parties are only occasional, they are very large, the aftermath of which is quite disturbing. The main complaint is the noise from the hordes of people leaving the party in the middle of the night. They stand around along the street, waiting for their Ubers. There is a steady stream of Uber traffic during this time,  with car doors slamming and drunk voices calling for their friends. Sometimes they rent party buses, which cause their own type of traffic congestion on the street as they wait with blaring music.   

Integrate this into previous paragraph: this occurs between 12am-2am and it is not restricted to weekends.  We’re a working family raising a child, and despite attempting adaptions such as earplugs, sound machines, and sound-drowning windows, we still experience disturbances in our sleep.   Not all families on the street have been able to make these changes. 

A secondary complaint relates to the disregard of their property, and the trash accumulation in the front yards. While they do have multiple city cans, they’re quickly overwhelmed with excess trash and are rarely brought back from the street.  Despite the cans, additional bags of trash remain the trash can storage areas.  And debris is about their yard and is found along the street.  At graduation time, the trash mound is massive and sits for weeks until a dumpster finally arrives to haul it away. 

We hope to urge the city and Duke to consider implementing stricter regulations that address these problems.

Kind regards,
Kathy & Mel
