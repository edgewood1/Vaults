Yes, if you want a comprehensive system based on a key ingredient, professional bakers typically categorize baked goods by their Leavening Agent (the ingredient that makes them rise).
In culinary science, almost every baked good falls into one of three categories based on what "engine" is used to create volume and texture.
1. Biological Leavening (The "Yeast" Category)
 * Key Ingredient: Yeast (a living organism).
 * How it works: The yeast eats sugar and releases carbon dioxide slowly over time. This requires patience (proofing/rising).
 * Examples: Sourdough, baguettes, brioche, pizza dough, cinnamon rolls.
 * Texture: Chewy, elastic, and airy structure (due to gluten development).
2. Chemical Leavening (The "Powder" Category)
 * Key Ingredient: Baking Soda or Baking Powder.
 * How it works: These chemicals react with moisture and heat to create gas bubbles instantly. There is no waiting for the dough to rise; you mix it and bake it immediately (hence the name "Quick Breads").
 * Examples: Muffins, cakes, cookies, biscuits, scones, banana bread.
 * Texture: Tender, crumbly, or cake-like.
3. Mechanical / Physical Leavening (The "Air & Steam" Category)
 * Key Ingredient: Eggs or Butter (manipulated by technique).
 * How it works: There are no artificial leaveners (no yeast, no soda). Instead, you trap air bubbles by whipping eggs, or you create layers of butter that release steam.
 * Examples:
   * Steam-leavened: Puff pastry, croissants, pie crusts (the water in the butter turns to steam and puffs up the layers).
   * Air-leavened: Soufflés, sponge cakes, angel food cake (whipped egg whites hold the air).
 * Texture: Flaky (pastry) or foamy/light (sponge).
Alternative View: Lean vs. Rich
If you prefer to categorize based on fat rather than the rising agent, bakers also divide doughs into two massive families:
| Category | Key Ingredients | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| Lean Doughs | Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast | Hard crust, chewy interior, low calorie. (e.g., French Bread, Pizza) |
| Rich Doughs | Added Fats (Butter, Oil), Sugar, Eggs | Soft crust, tender interior, cake-like. (e.g., Brioche, Dinner Rolls, Muffins) |
Summary for your mental model:
If you want to organize everything in baking, ask: "What makes it rise?"
 * Is it alive? -> Yeast Bread
 * Is it chemical? -> Cake/Cookie/Quick Bread
 * Is it steam/air? -> Pastry/Sponge
