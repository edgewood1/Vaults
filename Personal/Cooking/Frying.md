Yes, generally we fry food in Fat.
This is usually oil (vegetable, peanut, canola), but it can also be solid fats like butter, lard, shortening, or tallow.
The distinction between Frying and Grilling isn't just about the amount of oil—it is about the role the oil plays in cooking the food.
The Key Difference: The Role of the Oil
 * In Grilling: The oil is a Lubricant.
       You brush oil on the steak or the grate to keep the food from sticking. The oil is not what cooks the food; the radiant heat from the fire or heating element does.
 * In Frying: The oil is the Environment.
       The oil acts as the heat transfer medium. The fire heats the pan, the pan heats the oil, and the oil "hugs" the food to cook it. If you removed the oil, the cooking process would stop or change drastically (burning the contact points while leaving the rest raw).
The "Oil Depth" Spectrum
Culinary arts actually classify frying methods specifically by how deep the oil is. This helps distinguish it from grilling.
1. Grilling / Pan-Searing (Trace Amounts)
 * Oil Depth: A thin coating or a quick spray.
 * What happens: The food sits on metal. The oil just prevents tearing.
 * Result: Distinct char marks or crust only where the food touches the metal.
2. Sautéing (The "Jump")
 * Oil Depth: A thin film covering the bottom of the pan (about 1–2 tablespoons).
 * What happens: There is enough oil to conduct heat to the bottom surface of the food, but not the sides. You have to move (toss) the food constantly so it cooks evenly.
 * Result: Even browning on small pieces of food.
3. Pan-Frying (The "Halfway" Rule)
 * Oil Depth: The oil comes halfway up the side of the food.
 * What happens: This is the standard for fried chicken or a breaded pork chop. The oil cooks the bottom and the sides simultaneously. You flip the food once to cook the other half.
 * Result: A thick, crispy crust all around the exterior.
4. Deep-Frying (Submerged)
 * Oil Depth: The food is completely underwater (under-oil).
 * What happens: The food floats in the hot bath.
 * Result: The entire surface cooks instantly and evenly at the same time.
The Confusing Part: "Grilled" Cheese vs. "Fried" Egg
You might notice that a "Grilled Cheese" sandwich is actually cooked in a pool of butter in a frying pan. Technically, a Grilled Cheese is pan-fried.
 * Why do we call it grilling? This comes from "Griddling" (cooking on a flat metal plate).
 * The Rule: If you are cooking on a grate with gaps (BBQ), it is Grilling. If you are cooking on a flat solid surface with fat, it is technically Frying (specifically Sautéing or Pan-Frying), even if the menu calls it "Grilled."
