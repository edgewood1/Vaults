That is a very common way to simplify cooking, and in a colloquial sense, yes, those four cover the vast majority of what happens in a home kitchen. They represent the four primary mediums of heat transfer: hot fat (frying), direct heat (grilling), hot air (baking), and hot water (boiling).
However, if you look at it through the lens of culinary science, that list is incomplete. Culinary arts typically categorize cooking methods into three buckets based on how heat is transferred: Dry Heat, Moist Heat, and Combination Cooking.
Here is how your four methods fit into the technical framework, and what key methods are missing.
1. Dry Heat Cooking
This method transfers heat to food without using water. It relies on air, fat, or metal. This is where you get browning (the Maillard reaction).
 * Baking / Roasting: Uses hot air (convection).
 * Grilling / Broiling: Uses direct radiant heat (from below for grilling, from above for broiling).
 * Frying (Sautéing, Deep-frying):  Surprisingly, frying is considered "dry heat" because it uses fat, not water, to transfer heat.
 * The Missing Method: Sautéing. While technically a form of frying, it is distinct enough in technique (small amount of fat, high motion) that it is often listed separately.
2. Moist Heat Cooking
This method uses water, liquid, or steam to transfer heat.
 * Boiling: Submerging food in water at 212°F (100°C).
 * The Major Missing Method: Steaming. Steaming is distinct from boiling because the food never touches the water; it is cooked by the vapor. This is a crucial method for vegetables and seafood that doesn't fit into your "Boiling" category perfectly.
 * Poaching/Simmering: These are gentler versions of boiling (lower temperatures), but can be grouped under "Boiling" broadly.
3. Combination Cooking
These methods use both dry and moist heat. You usually brown the food first (Dry) and then cook it in liquid (Moist).
 * The Major Missing Category: Braising and Stewing. This is how you cook pot roasts or curries. If you only had your list of four, you wouldn't be able to describe a Pot Roast (which is seared, then slow-cooked in liquid).

Summary Table

If you want a truly complete "General List," you should probably expand it to six methods to cover all bases:

| Method          | Heat Medium  | Example                       |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Baking/Roasting | Hot Air      | Roast Chicken, Bread          |
| Grilling        | Radiant Heat | Burgers, Kebabs               |
| Frying          | Hot Fat      | French Fries, Sautéed Veggies |
| Boiling         | Hot Water    | Pasta, Potatoes               |
| Steaming        | Hot Vapor    | Broccoli, Dumplings           |
| Braising        | Fat + Liquid | Pot Roast, Stew               |

The Bottom Line:
Your list of four is a great "rule of thumb" because it covers the four elements: Air (Baking), Fire (Grilling), Fat (Frying), and Water (Boiling). Just remember that Steaming is the most significant outlier that doesn't fit neatly into those four.
Would you like to know more about the specific differences between "Baking" and "Roasting," which are often used interchangeably?
