Yes, thinking of flour as "grades of steel" is the perfect mental model. The "strength" of the flour is determined by its Protein Content (specifically gluten).
Here is the hierarchy of "Construction Materials" available to you, from weakest to strongest.
1. Cake Flour (The "Aluminum Foil")
 * Protein: 6–8%
 * The Physics: This flour has very little structural integrity. It cannot hold up a heavy building. It creates a "crumb" that is soft, velvety, and falls apart easily in your mouth.
 * Best For: Angel Food Cake, White Cake, Sponges.
 * What happens if you use it for bread: The bread won't rise; it will likely collapse into a dense, sad puddle because the "foil" can't hold the air pressure.
2. Pastry Flour (The "Copper Wire")
 * Protein: 8–9%
 * The Physics: Stronger than foil, but still very pliable. It is designed to be "tender" but not "mushy." It finds the balance between holding a shape (like a pie crust edge) and shattering when you bite it.
 * Best For: Pie crusts, biscuits, scones, cookies (if you like them tender).
3. All-Purpose Flour (The "Standard Wood/Lumber")
 * Protein: 10–12%
 * The Physics: This is the middle ground. It has enough gluten to make a decent loaf of bread (the frame will stand), but it’s soft enough to make a decent cookie (it won't break your teeth).
 * Best For: Almost everything if you aren't a specialist. Cookies, brownies, muffins, simple breads.
4. Bread Flour (The "Structural Steel")
 * Protein: 12–14%
 * The Physics: This is heavy-duty stuff. It forms a thick, rubbery elastic web. When you knead this, it fights back. It captures massive air bubbles without popping.
 * Best For: Yeasted artisan breads, dinner rolls, cinnamon rolls.
 * What happens if you use it for cake: You get a "rubber" cake. It will be tough, chewy, and unpleasant to eat (like chewing on a sweet sponge).
5. High-Gluten Flour (The "Titanium")
 * Protein: 14–16%
 * The Physics: Extreme elasticity and chew. This is for food that needs to undergo "stress" (like being boiled before baking) or needs to be extremely chewy.
 * Best For: Bagels and New York Style Pizza. (If you've ever wondered why a bagel makes your jaw tired but a muffin doesn't—this is why. It's the flour strength).
Two Special Exceptions
There are two flours that confuse people because they don't fit the "Strength" scale cleanly:
1. Whole Wheat Flour (The "Rebar with Rust")
 * The Trick: Whole wheat actually has very high protein (often 14%+).
 * The Problem: It also contains the Bran (the hard outer shell of the wheat berry).
 * The Result: The bran acts like tiny razor blades. As the gluten "net" tries to form, the sharp bran flakes slice through the strands. This is why 100% whole wheat bread is often dense and heavy—the "steel" is strong, but it keeps getting cut by the ingredients.
2. Italian "00" Flour (The "Finely Machined Steel")
 * The Trick: "00" refers to how finely it is ground (like baby powder), not its strength.
 * The Physics: It usually has medium strength (like AP or Bread flour), but because the particles are so tiny, it requires less water and stretches incredibly thin without tearing.
 * Best For: Neapolitan Pizza and Pasta (where you want a thin, delicate sheet).
Final Rule of Thumb
If you are standing in the grocery store aisle confused:
 * Chewy = High Protein (Bread Flour)
 * Tender/Flaky = Low Protein (Cake/Pastry Flour)
 * In the Middle = All-Purpose
