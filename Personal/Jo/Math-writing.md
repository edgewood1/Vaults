Questions to Ask During Reading:
* Before reading: Ask the child what they think will happen based on the cover or title, what characters might be in the book, and if they have any prior knowledge about the topic.
* During reading: Ask about predictions, how the character is feeling, what pictures they see in their mind, and what questions they have.
* After reading: Ask about their favorite part, how the problem was solved, if they would change anything, and what they learned. You can also encourage them to retell the story, discuss the main idea, and make connections to their own lives. 
Remember:
* Tailor the questions to the child's age and reading level.
* Encourage critical thinking by asking "why" and "how" questions.
* Make reading a fun and engaging experience for the child.
