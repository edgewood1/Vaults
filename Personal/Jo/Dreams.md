# Dreams


She’s been going through lots of changes starting at a new school.  It’s reflected in her busy dreams of late full of dolphins leaping high above their glistening lake adobes, good witches gliding thru the clouds and paw patrolling the perimeter and rainbow unicorns guarding the mountain passes.  I wake at 4am with her standing there in the shadows.  Creepy indeed.  And she tells me about them before I suggest she head back to rest. Luckily she does.  Congrats, kiddo.
