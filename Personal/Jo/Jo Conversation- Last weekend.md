# Jo Conversation: Last weekend

1. What happened?
* We went to a food hall where the food wasn’t what you liked.
* You got hungry and upset.
* When we came home, there were tantrums and pushing.
* Mom and Dad also got upset.
2. How did everyone feel?
* You felt hungry, frustrated, and unheard.
* Mom felt stressed and overwhelmed.
* Dad felt upset when everyone was fighting.
3. What did we learn?
* Being hungry makes it harder to stay calm.
* Everyone needs breaks when they get upset.
* Parents make mistakes too, and that’s okay to admit.
* Talking about feelings can help instead of pushing or yelling.
4. What can we try next time?
* Make sure we all eat before we go out.
* Choose food places together when possible.
* If you feel upset, use words to tell us, “I need a break” or “I feel hungry.”
* If Mom or Dad feels stressed, we can also take a step back before reacting.
