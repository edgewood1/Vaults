# Hey there!

# 


Yesterday, Fina and I stepped out onto the porch for our walk when we came across the flower gift and letter.  We were both curiously surprised, and it was a pretty powerful experience to see the change in Fina’s demeanor when she began reading the letter and realized it was from Anya.  It really had an impact on her, and at the start of our walk, we were able to process the experience, and the nature of social circumstances, peer pressure, and the like.   I think because of her size she is sensitive to slights of any sort, but she’s working on the fact that this is a common experience and she’s got options and it’s a pointless exercise to work out what exactly happened or what motives might have been involved.  The point is that there’s awareness and reconciliation.  We all have our freedom of movement and also freedom to dictate how we will feel.  While we can’t control our feeling, having some say, questioning the situation, can help us achieve a modicum of equanimity from where we can communicate with the other without judgment. I’m glad the kids were able to explore these. 

We wanted to thank you for that, and share that even though Fina had gotten over things, even if with a bit of uncertainty, the letter proved to be a large point of realization, confirmation, and good teaching moment.  So thanks, and we appreciate your friendship.

Hey Rob and Tilanthi,

It was such a touching surprise when we stepped out to the porch yesterday and found Anya’s thoughtful letter and gift, and it was moving to see the shift in Fina as she read Anya's words.  The letter helped turn the episode into a valuable teaching moment about friendship and forgiveness, which we were able to talk about on our walk that evening.

Thanks for taking the time for that & we appreciate the kindness and friendship. 
Hope to see you all soon!
