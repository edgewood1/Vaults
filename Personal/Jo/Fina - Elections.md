# Fina - Elections



* Elections are not a game: no winners or losers.
* In a game, at the end, the winner doesn’t have to do anything. 
* In an election, in the end there is a president, but then the president has to do a job for a period of time. 
* It is a process for choosing who will be the class representative, who is called the president. 
* In an election, the winner makes a victory speech.
* And the other people make “concession” speech. 

Concession
* I hope the new president is good
* I look forward to working with them.
* I congratulate them..
* We respect the election system.
* I want our class to be the best class ever. 
* I wish him good luck because if she does well, then we do well.
