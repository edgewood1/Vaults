# Josie Conference


- She’s always wanted to push the envelop with doing things on her own (or solving things on her own.
- Josie is not perfect, but whatever idiosyncrasies don’t warrant having to endure her.
- It’s getting hard for her to think of school without thinking of her - she’s less eager and excited to attend.
- Fear that she’s picking up some of these behaviors as acceptable (because she sees it repeatedly tolerated).  She lied the other day.


Possible solutions
- pairing with Blair / 1st graders
- Maybe visit their house (play date?)
- A helicopter in playground
