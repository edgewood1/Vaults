# You:



“Hey sweetie, can we talk for a minute about what happened with your new gift the other day? I’ve been thinking about it.”

*(Pause, give her a chance to look up or nod.)*

“I got upset when you were angry and took it out on your gift. I told you we’d take a break from gifts for a while, and I took it away. I’ve been thinking about that, and I think I overreacted. I’m sorry for handling it that way.”

*(Pause again—she may just listen quietly.)*

“I know you were really upset. Everyone gets angry sometimes, and it’s okay to feel that way. What matters is what we do with those feelings. I think you were trying to show how big your frustration felt, and I should’ve helped you find a better way to let it out.”

*(Invite her in)*
“Can you tell me what was going on for you that day? What made you feel so mad?”

*(Listen and validate—something like “Yeah, that must’ve been really frustrating” or “That makes sense, I get why you felt that way.”)*

Then you might say:
“I want us to come up with some ideas for next time you feel really angry—things that won’t hurt your toys or make you feel worse. Maybe we could write or draw some ideas together—like squeezing a pillow, stomping your feet, drawing your feelings, or coming to tell me you need a break.”

*(Pause, then gently reintroduce the gift)*
“And I think we can give your gift another chance. I know you didn’t mean to hurt it—you just had a big feeling in that moment. Let’s take care of it together, okay?”

*(End with connection)*
“I love you no matter what, even when we both have big feelings. We’ll keep learning together.”
