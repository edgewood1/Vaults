# Fina camp


Let’s check in about this before setting it in stone. I’m not sure this order is necessary.  But she liked the idea of 2 Notasiums and 2 DACs and the theater.  

I think 2 DAC’s might be too much since they’re both 2-week programs (India & Argentina).

Can we also check Duke string school.  *(String school summer camp starts at Age 7)*

June
1. In school still for the first week of June
2. MLS Lego Code
3. DAC India
4. DAC India (
5. *India is 2 weeks long, no class Juneteenth).*
6. *June 30th - July 4th Stay home week or vacation*July
1. DA Kora
2. Notasium piano
3. Vault Frozen
4. MLS Detective
August
1. AcroSport Gymnastics
2. Notasium Uke

We could replace a DA Kora with Gymnastics even though she said she didn’t want to re-do it.  We could try one week toward the end of summer? *Did she understand that it wouldn’t be at the same place? It would be at her new place. I can talk to them to see how much gymnastics they do during the day vs. other stuff.*

Delete one of these lines for vacation/staycation.  Another idea is we do a 3-day yoga workshop and leave 2 days before / after to un/pack. Or a 5 day music thing or crafts thing.
