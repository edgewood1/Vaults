# Jo - violin

A major scale 
Use an a drone

C major scale

three bow strokes (martelé, detachè and legato) 

good bow arm level to play each string nicely.

**experiment and practice how upper arm/elbow determines the bow angle to play the correct string. Not your bow hand, wrist, or fingers (these parts stay in relaxed good position)**

Practice:
* Whole “Hungarian Folk Tune” 
* Piano soft
* Forte strong
* The tempo of the song is Quarter= 70~80. 
* use a metronome 
* If it’s too fast at this point, please start practicing slower, and try getting faster one click at a time. Or/And, try playing in the tempo for one section, or even two measures at a time. 
* First line (both parts) of “Pastoral"
* “Pastoral” tempo. Quarter = 90
* We couldn’t get to this last Saturday. We will start with Pastoral next class
