Here’s a cleaned-up and accurate version of your answers — simple enough for grades 2–3 but still correct:

⸻

**Do some people not get reactions to poison ivy, and why?**
	•	About 1 in 10 people don’t react right away.
	•	Some immune systems don’t see the plant’s oil as a threat.
	•	Sensitivity can change — you might react later in life even if you didn’t before.

⸻

**Does poison ivy do anything good for the environment?**
	•	Birds eat its berries in winter.
	•	People avoid poison ivy patches, which gives mice, insects, and small animals safe shelter.
	•	Its deep roots help hold soil in place and prevent erosion.

⸻

**When poison ivy gets on your skin, how long does it take to go away?**
	•	Usually 2–3 weeks.
	•	First, the skin turns red and itchy.
	•	Then it may blister and ooze fluid.
	•	Finally, it forms a crust and heals.

If you want, I can also make a **colorful printable version** of both so kids can use them as a handout or activity sheet. That way it’s ready to use in class.
