# Stones


<u>**Picture one: lots**</u>

* Quartz or a 
* Feldspar mineral (like Orthoclase or Plagioclase), possibly with some iron staining or impurities giving it a light pink or milky color. 
* It could be Rose Quartz if it's pure Quartz.

**Dark Grey/Black Stone (Bottom):** This appears to be 
* Smoky Quartz due to its translucent dark color and shape, or 
* it could be a piece of a dark igneous rock like Basalt or Gabbro.

**Small Grey/Greenish Stone (Center)**: This piece has a speckled or crystalline texture and could be a piece of 
* Granite, 
* Diorite, or another type of rock rich in minerals like 
* Serpentine or Chlorite.

<u>**Picture 2: crystals**</u>

These are almost certainly treated Quartz crystals, commonly known as "Aura Quartz."

The base mineral is natural Quartz (silicon dioxide), which is then treated with a high-heat process to permanently bond various metals to its surface. This process creates the striking iridescent, metallic sheen.

* | Top Left (Red/Pink/Gold Iridescence) Deep pink/red with a metallic, rainbow sheen. | Flame Aura Quartz or Tanzine Aura Quartz | Gold and Niobium (or similar combinations). |

* | Center (Dark Blue/Teal Iridescence) | Deep, saturated blue and green with a metallic sheen. | Aqua Aura Quartz or Peacock Ore Aura | Gold and possibly Indium or Niobium. |

* | Center Right (Clear with White Tip) | Clear/white with a natural, uncolored look. | Natural Quartz Point | Untreated. This is the base material for the others. |

* | Center Bottom (Green/Blue/Clear) | Clear base with a bright green/blue color. | Kiwi Aura Quartz or Angel Aura Quartz (with a green tint) | Platinum and/or Silver. |

* | Bottom (Pale Yellow/Green) | Lightly tinted yellow-green, possibly slightly iridescent. | Prasiolite (though often heat-treated Amethyst) or Lemon Aura Quartz | Likely an Iron-based coating or simple heat treatment. |

Key Takeaways:
 * Mineral: The core is Quartz.
 * Color: The intense, metallic, and non-uniform colors are man-made (not naturally occurring in these shades and luster).
 * Name: They are sold commercially as various types of Aura Quartz (e.g., Aqua Aura, Angel Aura, Flame Aura).

Identification of the Blue and Dark Stones

* | Top (Light Blue/Aqua Rough Stone) | Light blue to aqua color, translucent, with distinct darker inclusions (black, purplish). It appears somewhat crystalline or cleavable. | Blue Fluorite with Black/Purple Inclusions (likely Manganese Oxide or another mineral). | Fluorite often comes in a pale blue/green/purple color and can be easily recognized by its cubic cleavage. |

* | Middle (Dark Blue Rough Rock) | Deep, mottled blue color, with patches of white/gray (likely Calcite or Plagioclase Feldspar) and possibly some metallic specks (Pyrite). It has a granular, massive structure. | Sodalite (or possibly Lapis Lazuli) | Sodalite is a deep blue mineral usually mixed with white/gray matrix. Lapis Lazuli is similar but tends to have more prominent golden Pyrite flecks and a deeper color. Based on the visible white, Sodalite is the more likely candidate. |

* | Bottom (Dark Blue Polished Oval) | A smooth, highly polished, dark, deep blue, translucent oval shape. | Blue Glass (or less likely, a very dark, polished Sodalite/Dumortierite Quartz). | Given the highly uniform color, glassy luster, and perfectly smooth, round shape, this is most likely a piece of man-made colored glass (sometimes called "Slag Glass" or a polished "Tumbled Stone" in the metaphysical community). |

Identification of the Polished Stone

* | Separate Image (Brown/Yellow Polished Oval) | Golden yellow/brown color with chatoyancy—a shimmering, silky luster that moves as you turn the stone (like a cat's eye). The bands are parallel and fibrous. | Tiger's Eye (a type of Quartz) | This is a classic example of Tiger's Eye, which is characterized by its distinctive golden-brown colors and the effect known as chatoyancy, caused by embedded parallel fibers of crocidolite that have been replaced by quartz. |

Set 1: Rough Quartz Varieties

All three of these stones appear to be varieties of Quartz (a mineral with a Mohs hardness of 7), which is very common and forms in many colors and clarity levels.

* | Top (Pale Yellow/Clear Rough Stone) | A chunky, irregular piece, translucent with a pale, buttery yellow or citrine tint. It has a glossy, glass-like fracture. | Raw Citrine (Yellow Quartz) or Lemon Quartz (often irradiated) | Citrine ranges from light yellow to reddish-orange. This piece has a classic chunky quartz shape and fracture, with the color coming from trace iron impurities or heat treatment. |

* | Middle (Smoky/Grey Rough Stone) | A translucent to opaque grey/brown color, often with internal fractures (known as jardin). | Raw Smoky Quartz | Smoky Quartz is colorless Quartz that has been naturally irradiated, which turns it brown or gray. It's often found in this rough, massive form. |

* | Bottom (Small, Cloudy White/Orange Speck) | A smaller, cloudy white piece with a glassy fracture and what looks like a tiny speck of orange or red staining. | Clear/Milky Quartz with Iron Staining | This is a very common piece of quartz. The milky appearance is due to microscopic fluid inclusions, and the small orange speck is likely a trace of Iron Oxide (rust). |

Set 2: Tumbled Green Stones
This set consists of tumbled (polished) stones, which makes identifying the original rough mineral slightly harder, but the colors are quite distinctive.

| Position | Appearance | Likely Identification | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|

* | Left (Light Blue-Green Tumbled Stone) | A smooth, polished stone with a light blue-green to aqua color, and areas of white or grey matrix. | Amazonite (a variety of Microcline Feldspar) or Green Beryl/Emerald in matrix. | Amazonite is a popular light blue-green feldspar that often contains streaks of white or gray. While the color could also suggest a low-grade Beryl/Emerald in its matrix, Amazonite is much more common in this tumbled, solid form. |
* | Center (Small, Bright Green Oval) | A small, perfectly smooth, uniform, bright green oval with a glassy appearance and a sharply defined, bright green line around the edge. | Green Glass (Possibly Seaglass or a decorative glass bead/gem) | The perfectly uniform color, high-gloss luster, and the very sharp rim suggest this is man-made glass, likely a decorative piece or tumbled fragment. |

* | Right (Dark Olive Green/Black Tumbled Stone) | A smooth stone with a mottled dark olive green and black appearance. | Serpentine or Epidote or Kambaba Jasper (Stromatolite Fossil) | Serpentine is very common in this color range and takes a good polish. If the dark areas are highly crystalline and the green is bright, it could be Epidote. If the pattern is made of distinct dark circles on a dark green background, it is Kambaba Jasper (a fossilized algae). |

Set 1: Marine Finds

The first image contains items that are not rocks or minerals but are fascinating natural specimens.
| Item | Appearance | Identification | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|

* | Center (Spiral Shape) | A long, pointed, conical shell with brown and white banding along the spiral. | Turritella Shell (or a similar auger-shaped marine gastropod shell) | These are common on beaches and are characterized by their tall, slender, spiral shape, resembling a tower. The shell material is calcium carbonate. |

* | Top Left (Small, Gray/Blue) | A small, flattened, often triangular or irregular piece with a smooth, concave surface. | Seashell Fragment or Pottery/Glass | This is likely a naturally tumbled piece of a shell or perhaps a fragment of pottery or glass that has been worn smooth by the ocean. The gray/blue color may be natural to the shell or from mineral staining. |

* | Top Right (Bony, Porous) | A very light-colored, porous, and highly irregular object with chambers. | Coral Fragment or Sea Urchin Test/Skeleton | This has a skeletal structure, suggesting it is a fragment of dead coral or, more likely, a broken piece of a large sea urchin test (shell) or sand dollar skeleton, which are made of calcium carbonate and have a distinctive porous structure. |

Set 2: Tumbled Stones

The second image shows two very similar, highly polished, dark-colored stones.
| Position | Appearance | Identification | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|

* | Top Right (Deep Red/Maroon Polished Stone) | A smooth, glossy, deep maroon or reddish-brown color, possibly with slight internal lighter patches or crystalline structure visible. | Red Jasper or Red Quartzite | Jasper is a microcrystalline Quartz variety known for its opaque, solid color, often red due to high iron content. Quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone, which is essentially pure Quartz and can be a solid maroon/red color. The high polish suggests a variety of hard quartz. |

* | Bottom Left (Dark Purple/Brown Polished Stone) | A smooth, glossy, very dark purplish-brown color, almost black, and opaque. | Mahogany Obsidian or Dark Jasper/Chert | Obsidian (a natural volcanic glass) can be very dark and takes a high, glass-like polish. Mahogany Obsidian often shows faint reddish-brown swirls within a black base. If it's not glass, it is likely a very dark variety of Jasper or Chert (both microcrystalline quartz). |

Given their high hardness and solid, non-transparent nature, the two polished stones are most likely a form of Jasper or Chert (a very fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of silica).
Would you like to continue identifying your collection, perhaps by returning to the original large stones, or focus on a specific piece from this set?


<u>**Last set**</u>

You have a great variety here! The two images show a set of polished tumbled stones and a very recognizable metallic mineral.

Set 1: Tumbled Stones
| Position | Appearance | Likely Identification | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|

* | Top Center (Round, Frosted) | A perfectly round, flat, grayish stone with a textured or "frosted" surface that appears to be man-made or heavily altered. | Frosted Glass Gem or Treated Quartz/Agate | The shape and surface texture strongly suggest this is a man-made glass gem (often used in flower arrangements or crafts) that has been chemically frosted or tumbled to a matte finish. Less likely, it could be a piece of Gray Agate that was etched. |

* | Bottom Left (Pale Yellow/Lime) | A smooth, highly polished, opaque stone with a very uniform, soft lime-yellow or pale green color. | Serpentine or Yellow Jade/Serpentine | The smooth polish and opaque, uniform color are typical of lower-hardness minerals. This could be a light-colored Serpentine (sometimes sold as "New Jade") or possibly a pale Prehnite or Aventurine if the color is from fine inclusions, though it appears quite solid. |

* | Right (Pink/Flesh-toned) | A smooth, polished, pink to flesh-toned stone with white streaks and a waxy luster. | Rhodonite or Pink Opal or Pink Calcite | Rhodonite is a manganese mineral, often pink with black inclusions, but it can be mostly pink. Pink Opal is also a possibility due to the smooth texture. Pink Calcite is another candidate, recognizable by its lower hardness and waxy luster. |

Set 2: Metallic Mineral
| Item | Appearance | Identification | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|

* | All Pieces (Gold/Silver, Granular) | Chunks of a rock matrix covered in tiny, sparkling, metallic gold to brass-colored crystals with a distinct cubic or pyritohedral habit (though often massive/granular like this). | Pyrite (Iron Sulfide) | This is an excellent specimen of Pyrite, often called "Fool's Gold" due to its metallic luster and brass-yellow color. It is common to find it as druzy (tiny crystals) coating a rock matrix like the pieces shown. |

Key Takeaway for Set 2: The metallic mineral is Pyrite.

<u>**Elements for stone ID**</u>

 * Color: (e.g., bright pink, milky white, speckled gray)
 * Luster: Is it glassy, dull, waxy, or metallic?
 * Texture/Shape: Is it smooth, rough, crystalline, or layered?
 * Hardness/Weight (Optional): Does it feel heavy for its size? Can you scratch it with a fingernail or a penny? (Note: Do this carefully, as some rocks are brittle.)
Would you like to start with the large pale green/white stone for a closer look?
