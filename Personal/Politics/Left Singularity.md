The concept of a "left political singularity" describes a recurring pattern in certain left-wing political movements. This pattern is characterized by a self-reinforcing cycle of escalating repression, where each phase becomes more extreme than the last. Historical examples include the French Red Terror, the Soviet Great Terror, and the Cambodian autogenocide. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is that left-wing repression tends to politicize all aspects of life, forcing conformity to a constantly shifting and increasingly radical "correct" ideology. This creates a dynamic where individuals and leaders compete to be "more left" than others, leading to purges of those deemed insufficiently radical. A key survival strategy in these regimes is the principle of "no enemies to the left," meaning that individuals must constantly demonstrate their ideological purity and avoid any association with those perceived as less radical.

This process stands in stark contrast to right-wing repression, which tends to depoliticize society. Regimes like Pinochet's encourage apathy and withdrawal from political life, whereas left-wing repression intensifies political engagement and ideological fervor. Leaders in these systems often become trapped, fearing being outflanked by more radical elements. They may attempt to curb the terror, but risk becoming its next victims. Historical examples illustrate this pattern. In the French Revolution, the monarchy's weakness and the rise of radical intellectuals created a vacuum that led to the Reign of Terror. Similarly, in Tsarist Russia, the path to power became being more left than one's rivals, leading to the eventual communist takeover.

The underlying theory posits that leftism, in this context, functions as a kind of "theocracy" that expands unchecked when it encounters weak resistance. It is driven by a constant pursuit of ideological purity, unlike right-wing movements, which are seen as more diverse and reactive. The constant shifting of what is considered acceptable within leftism creates a system where people are constantly trying to outdo one another, leading to a spiraling escalation of radicalism and repression.

Historical Examples in detail

To understand the concept of a "left political singularity," it's essential to examine the historical examples provided. The French Red Terror, or Reign of Terror, occurred during the French Revolution (1789-1799), a period of radical social and political upheaval. The revolution aimed to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic based on Enlightenment ideals. However, internal and external threats, including counter-revolutionary forces and foreign invasions, created a climate of fear and paranoia. The Reign of Terror (1793-1794) was a period of intense violence, characterized by mass executions, primarily by guillotine. The Committee of Public Safety, led by Maximilien Robespierre, played a central role in orchestrating the Terror. Anyone suspected of opposing the revolution, including nobles, clergy, and even fellow revolutionaries, was targeted. The pursuit of "virtue" and "purity" led to a cycle of escalating accusations and executions. This period demonstrates the radicalization of revolutionary ideals, where those perceived as insufficiently radical were purged. The creation of a climate of fear, where individuals were compelled to demonstrate their loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and the escalation of violence, as the pursuit of ideological purity intensified, are key aspects relating to the "left political singularity" concept.

The Soviet Great Terror, or the Great Purge, occurred in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Joseph Stalin in the late 1930s. Stalin sought to consolidate his power and eliminate any perceived threats to his regime. The Soviet Union was a one-party state, where the Communist Party held absolute authority. The Great Terror (1936-1938) was a period of widespread political repression and persecution. Millions of people were arrested, exiled, or executed, including political opponents, military leaders, and ordinary citizens. Show trials were used to publicly humiliate and condemn those accused of "counter-revolutionary" activities. The NKVD (Soviet secret police) played a crucial role in carrying out the purges. Stalin's paranoia and the drive to eliminate any potential rivals, the creation of a system where ideological conformity was enforced through terror, the self-reinforcing nature of the purges, and the idea that no one was safe, are all key aspects relating to the "left political singularity" concept. In both of these examples, you see how revolutionary or highly ideological states can begin to devour themselves. The need to maintain ideological purity, and the fear of being seen as an enemy of the state, creates a situation where the states become more and more extreme.
