Biosurveillance is a process that detects disease in people, plants, or animals. It detects and characterizes outbreaks of disease. It monitors the environment for bacteria, viruses, and other biological agents that cause disease. The biosurveillance process _systematically_ collects and analyzes data for the purpose of detecting cases of disease, outbreaks of disease, and environmental conditions that predispose to disease.

Detection of disease _outbreaks_ is of particular importance. Unlike explosions, disease outbreaks are silent. Disease outbreaks sicken or kill individuals before they are detected. Disease outbreaks can inflict this damage quickly, and they can also spread quickly. The window of opportunity to limit this damage can be as brief as a few days in the worst case

The United States spends billions of dollars per year on various forms of biosurveillance. The major expenditures are for hospital infection control, public health surveillance, surveillance of the air and water, training, improvement of the information technology infrastructure for public health, and research

Biosurveillance is also a rapidly growing scientific field at the intersection of epidemiology, artificial intelligence, microbiology, computer science, statistics, system engineering, medicine, and veterinary medicine.
