The [[American Compass]] article "Has Civil Society Become Part of the Problem?" argues that the traditional conservative view of civil society as a bulwark against the excesses of the market and the state needs a serious reevaluation. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

- **Traditional Conservative View:** The article outlines the conventional conservative understanding of civil society as a sphere of voluntary associations, community groups, and religious institutions that provides a counterbalance to the power of both government and the market. It's seen as a source of social cohesion, moral values, and individual responsibility.
    
- **Civil Society's Transformation:** The author argues that civil society has fundamentally changed and no longer functions as this independent counterweight. Instead, it has become increasingly aligned with the interests of either the market or the state, losing its distinct character.
    
- **Monolith and Constraining:** The article contends that civil society has become increasingly monolithic, dominated by a narrow set of progressive values and perspectives. This creates a chilling effect on dissenting voices and makes it difficult for individuals who don't conform to these norms to participate fully. It's seen as less of a space for diverse viewpoints and more of an enforcer of social conformity.
    
- **Subject to Same Dynamics:** The author argues that civil society is now subject to the same dynamics as markets and states, including the pursuit of power, influence, and resources. This means that it can be just as prone to corruption, inequality, and the abuse of power.
    
- **Loss of Localism:** The article laments the decline of localism in civil society. It suggests that national organizations and agendas have come to dominate, crowding out local initiatives and making it harder for communities to address their specific needs.
    
- **Erosion of Trust:** The author suggests that the increasing politicization of civil society has eroded trust in its institutions. People are less likely to participate in groups or organizations if they believe they are simply fronts for partisan agendas.
    
- **Need for Reassessment:** The article concludes that conservatives need to reassess their understanding of civil society. They should be more critical of its potential downsides and less reliant on it as a simple solution to the problems of the market and the state. It implies a need to find new ways to foster community, promote civic engagement, and address social problems.
    
- **Emphasis on the Common Good:** While critical of the current state of civil society, the article doesn't dismiss its importance altogether. Instead, it suggests a need to revitalize it by focusing on the common good and fostering genuine dialogue and deliberation across different perspectives.
