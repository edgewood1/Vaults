“experimental biotech products, the namely the mRNA vaccines, that were produced downstream of Operation warp”

Made many valid critiques of how covid Response unfolded.  

Bill Cassidy, who has big ties to big pharma and vaccine development endorsed RFK bc RFK committed to it. He’s sponsored by Ochsner health system who increased insurance costs for their employees with unvaccinated spouses during the pandemic. 

Trump sidelines RFK’s anti-vaccine aides.  Heather Flick, is chief of staff of HHS under RFK, who is not anti-vaccine.  

RFK might just focus on big food and exercise.

Oracle’s’ Larry Ellison - Stargate.  New era of AI powered personalized mRNA vaccine for cancer.  You can charge more because you making a personalized vaccine.  This is reason Biden created the ARPA-H the health darpa agency.  Cancer moonshot.  

ARPAH - initially was framed as a pre-crime tool.  Then it transitioned to a predictive health program.  Rob Writght is behind it.  

Efficacy Data collection through bio surveillance. 

Lutnick - new head of FDA himself. 
Marty Makary — pro-biotech / vaccine stocks
He was unhappy that Covid-19 vaccine to be approved. 

Oniel wants elliminate efficacy tests, but not efficacy data collection.  They should take vaccine, and then track them.

Creating artifical demand for products people don’t want. 

Gilead - 

BARDA is an atm for big pharma.  
Bird flu manufactured by people who are…

Stats can manufacture fear. 

Anthrax attacks.  2001. 
Bio terror is coming so boost stockpiles of bio solutions.  
Gulf war syndrome. 
Jerome Hunter “engineering contagion”

Create welfare for big phrarma
Create fear - used to take away people’s civil liberity - surrender bodily autonomy. 

How to collect the most of real world data outside of clinical trial settings - electronic health records, [[wearables]], 

Collect data to cultivate capital and value for drug products with them getting nothing in return.  Patient populations should be surveillance to allowpharma to develop outcome focused way of creating drugs.  

Surveillance education 
Clouds capital industry
they use my data and they develop a better drug sounds great.  But in all cases it’s used to exploit the consumer and the worker and increase prices and cut costs.  
Data could be used by insurance companies to charge higher premiums  based on what wearables bring in.
