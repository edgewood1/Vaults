Wrote the [Techno-Optimist Manifesto] The essay argues that many significant problems of humanity have been solved with the development of technology, particularly technology without any constraints, and that we should do everything possible to accelerate technology development and advancement. Technology, according to Andreessen, is what drives wealth and happiness.

The essay is considered a manifesto for [effective accelerationism] 

[Effective acceleration] advocates for an explicitly [pro-technology]"Technological utopianism" stance

Its proponents believe that unrestricted [technological progress] is a solution to universal human problems like poverty, war and climate change.

They see themselves as a counterweight to more cautious views on technological innovation, often giving their opponents the derogatory labels of "[doomers]” or "decels" (short for [decelerationists] 

The movement carries [utopian]  "Utopia" undertones and argues that humans need to develop and build faster to ensure their survival and propagate [consciousness] and the pseudonymous Bayeslord see it as a way to "usher in the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms."

While [Nick Land] is seen as the intellectual originator of contemporary [accelerationism]in general 

the precise origins of effective accelerationism remain unclear
