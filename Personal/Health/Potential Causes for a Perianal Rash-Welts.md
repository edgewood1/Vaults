# Potential Causes for a Perianal Rash/Welts

# 

* **Contact Dermatitis (Irritant or Allergic):** This is a very common cause of rashes in the perianal area and is often due to the sensitive skin coming into contact with a chemical or physical irritant.
	* **Common culprits:** Soaps (especially perfumed ones), wet wipes (due to fragrances or preservatives), laundry detergents/fabric softeners, certain topical medications (like local anesthetics or some hemorrhoid creams), or dyes in toilet paper.
	* **Appearance:** A red, inflamed, and potentially swollen rash that can be very itchy or burning. In acute cases, small blisters, oozing, or crusting may occur.
* **Hives (Urticaria):** These are swollen, red, bumpy rashes (welts) that can appear anywhere on the body and result from the body's reaction to allergens, heat, stress, or infections. Hives typically appear quickly and fade within hours or a few days, but they can be intensely itchy.
* **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):**People with a history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever are more prone to this in the perianal region. The rash is typically red, dry, and scaly, with potential for cracking or weeping clear fluid from scratching.
* **Intertrigo:** This is dermatitis caused by skin rubbing against skin in a warm, moist area, which can lead to inflammation and make the skin more susceptible to secondary fungal or bacterial infections. The rash can be itchy, burning, or painful.
* **Fungal Infection (e.g., Candidiasis or Ringworm):** In the warm, moist environment around the anus, fungi can thrive, causing a bright red, raw-looking rash (candidiasis) or a ring-shaped rash (ringworm/jock itch). 

## **Immediate Recommendations**
Since you suspect a rash or allergic reaction, the primary goal is to identify and remove the potential irritant and soothe the skin:
1. **Identify and eliminate irritants:**Stop using all perfumed soaps, wet wipes, and any new laundry products. Gently clean the area with just warm water after a bowel movement.
3. **Keep the area dry and cool:** Pat the area dry gently after washing (do not rub), and consider using a hair dryer on a cool setting. Wear loose-fitting cotton underwear to allow for ventilation.
5. **Soothe the skin:** Use a barrier cream containing **zinc oxide** or plain **petroleum jelly** to protect the inflamed skin from moisture and friction.
11. **Relieve itching:** Over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream may be used for a short period (a week or two) to reduce inflammation and itching, as instructed by a doctor. Oral antihistamines can also help manage the itch. 

## **Next Steps**
Self-care measures may help, but you should still **consult a healthcare provider** for a definitive diagnosis, as treatments for a fungal infection, bacterial infection, or simple irritation differ. A doctor can take a history, perform a visual exam, or, if needed, take a skin scraping to ensure the correct treatment (e.g., antifungal cream, topical steroids, or antibiotics) is prescribed
