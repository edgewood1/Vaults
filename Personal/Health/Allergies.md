Allergies

Based on your IgE table, you should primarily **avoid codfish, salmon, milk, and milk products containing alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin, as well as egg whites.**


## **Understanding Your Results**

Your IgE test results measure your body's level of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in response to specific allergens. Higher IgE levels suggest a greater likelihood of an allergic reaction. The **kU/L** value indicates the concentration of these antibodies, and the **class** provides a general risk category.
* **Class 0:** A very low or undetectable level of IgE antibodies, indicating a minimal to no risk of an allergy.
* **Class I and higher:** Suggests a sensitization to the allergen, meaning your body has developed IgE antibodies against it. This indicates an increased risk of an allergic reaction.

## **Your Specific Allergies**

Based on the provided data, here's a breakdown of what you should avoid and why:
* **Codfish (0.24 kU/L) and Salmon (0.21 kU/L):** Both of these are listed as **"Abnormal"** with a Class 0/I, indicating a low but present risk of an allergic reaction. While the levels aren't high, it's prudent to avoid them. The other seafood items listed (tuna, scallop, shrimp) are Class 0, so they are likely safe.
* **Milk (0.52 kU/L):** Your overall milk IgE is **"Abnormal"** with a Class I, indicating a mild allergy to milk proteins. The breakdown shows that you are allergic to specific components:
	* **Alpha-lactalbumin (0.67 kU/L):** This is your highest reading and is classified as **Class II**, which indicates a more significant reaction risk. This protein is found in whey.
	* **Beta-lactoglobulin (0.31 kU/L):** Also "Abnormal," this protein is also a major component of whey.
	* **Casein:** Your reading for casein is Class 0, so you likely are not allergic to this protein found in milk curds.
* **Egg White (0.17 kU/L):** The result is listed as **"Abnormal,"** indicating a mild sensitivity. You should be careful with products that contain egg whites.

## **Safe Foods**

You should be able to safely consume **almonds, tuna, scallops, and shrimp**, as their IgE levels are less than 0.10 kU/L, which falls under Class 0.

So can you provide a list of foods to avoid. Also can I drink soy milk


Based on your allergy test results, here is a list of foods to avoid and an explanation regarding soy milk.

## **Foods to Avoid**

The following foods and ingredients should be avoided based on your IgE levels:
* **Codfish****Salmon****Milk** and all milk products, including but not limited to:
	* Butter
	* Cheese (all types)
	* Cream and sour cream
	* Yogurt
	* Ice cream
	* Whey protein (since you are sensitive to alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin, which are whey proteins)
	* Caseinates (though your test for Casein was negative, it's a common milk protein and some products with caseinates might also contain other milk proteins)
* **Egg White** and foods containing it, such as:
	* Mayonnaise
	* Some baked goods (cakes, cookies, pastries)
	* Meringue
	* Some breaded foods or batters
When checking food labels, be on the lookout for other names for milk and egg white.
**For Milk:** Look for ingredients like whey, alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, lactose, milk solids, and milk powder. **For Egg White:** Look for ovalbumin (the main protein in egg white), ovomucoid, and albumen.

## **Can I drink soy milk?**

**In most cases, yes, you can drink soy milk.** It is a common and safe alternative for people with a cow's milk allergy. Soy milk is made from soybeans and does not contain the cow's milk proteins (casein, alpha-lactalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin) that you are allergic to.
However, it is important to be aware that some people with a cow's milk allergy can also develop an allergy to soy. This is more common in infants and young children, and it appears to be less common in adults. Since you do not have any soy-related IgE results on your table, it is highly probable that you are not allergic to soy.
**A few key points about soy milk:**
* It is a good source of protein and is often fortified with calcium and vitamins to be nutritionally comparable to cow's milk.
* Always check the label to ensure the brand you choose is not processed on equipment that also handles dairy, as cross-contamination can occur. This is often noted on the packaging.
* While soy is a safe alternative for you, other plant-based milks like oat, almond (which your test showed you are not allergic to), or rice milk are also good options.

Can I have fried or scrambled or boiled eggs

This is an excellent and very important question. The way an egg is cooked can significantly affect its allergenic potential for some people, but not for others.

Based on your IgE results for egg white (0.17 kU/L, Abnormal), you have a mild sensitivity. This means that you are more likely to be in the group of people who can tolerate some forms of cooked egg.

## **Understanding the Role of Cooking**

The protein responsible for most egg white allergies is **ovalbumin**. Ovalbumin is a heat-sensitive protein. When it's cooked at high temperatures for a long time (like in baking), its structure is changed, or "denatured," which makes it less likely to trigger an allergic reaction.

However, another major egg white protein, **ovomucoid**, is heat-stable. For individuals who are highly allergic to ovomucoid, even well-cooked egg will cause a reaction. Your test did not break down the specific components of the egg white, but your low overall IgE level suggests you may be more sensitive to the heat-labile proteins.


## **Fried, Scrambled, or Boiled Eggs**

* **Fried and Scrambled Eggs:** These eggs are cooked quickly and at a lower temperature compared to baking. This means the proteins are not as thoroughly denatured. Therefore, they are more likely to cause an allergic reaction for someone with an egg white allergy.
* **Boiled Eggs:** Hard-boiled eggs are cooked for a longer period at a high temperature, which can help denature the allergenic proteins. This makes them potentially safer than fried or scrambled eggs, but still not as safe as extensively baked eggs.

## **General Guidelines and Recommendations**

Given your specific results, the safest approach is to **avoid all forms of eggs** (fried, scrambled, and boiled) for now. The cooking methods you asked about do not provide the same level of heat denaturation as baking, so they pose a higher risk.
If you are eager to test your tolerance to cooked eggs, you should **only do so under the guidance of a doctor or a board-certified allergist**. They may suggest a "food challenge" in a clinical setting to see if you can tolerate extensively baked eggs (e.g., in a muffin or cake). This should **NEVER be attempted at home**, as there is still a risk of a severe reaction.


**Summary:**
| Type of Egg                        | Allergenicity                      | Recommendation for you             |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Raw Egg                            | Highest                            | AVOID                              |
| Fried/Scrambled                    | High                               | AVOID                              |
| Boiled                             | Moderate-High                      | AVOID                              |

What sort of reaction would scrambled eggs give me. Gut irritation. Diahestive issues?

Based on your IgE results for egg white, which indicate a mild allergy, a reaction to scrambled eggs could manifest in several ways, including gut and digestive issues.
It is important to understand that food allergy symptoms can be unpredictable and can vary from person to person and even from one reaction to the next.

## **Potential Symptoms**

An allergic reaction to scrambled eggs could involve one or more of the following:
**1. Gastrointestinal Symptoms:**
* **Stomach cramps or abdominal pain****Nausea****Vomiting****Diarrhea****2. Skin Symptoms:**
* **Hives (raised, red, itchy welts)****Rash****Swelling of the lips, face, or eyes****3. Respiratory Symptoms:**
* **Nasal congestion or a runny nose****Sneezing****Wheezing or shortness of breath****A tight feeling in the throat or chest**While your IgE level is on the lower side, it's crucial to remember that a "mild" allergy doesn't mean a reaction will always be mild. Even a small amount of an allergen can sometimes trigger a severe reaction called **anaphylaxis**, which is a medical emergency.




## **Anaphylaxis**

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms can include:


* Difficulty breathing due to throat swelling
* A sudden drop in blood pressure, leading to dizziness or fainting
* A rapid pulse
* Shock
Given the unpredictable nature of food allergies, it is always the safest course of action to completely avoid a known allergen. Since scrambled eggs are not extensively cooked and the allergenic proteins are not as denatured as they would be in a baked good, they pose a higher risk of triggering a reaction.
