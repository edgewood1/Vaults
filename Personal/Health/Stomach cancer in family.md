***Signs of burnout***
* *You are exhausted all the time, no matter how many hours you spend in bed**A sense of isolation from other people, and even from yourself, to the extent of becoming a virtual recluse**Ineffectual, no matter how much work you put in**A feeling of emotional deadness**Loss of empathy for other people’s problems even when it is your job to be empathetic**Feeling of being trapped**Increase in cynicism**Loss of sense of humour**Loss of sex drive in a relationship but other activities that can become addictive such as drinking, shopping and internet chatting**Increase in physical problems including back and heart pain, headaches, frozen shoulder, chronic fatigue, adrenal and thyroid problems, irritable bowel syndrome, post-viral illnesses, viral meningitis and even heart attacks**Rising dislike for yourself and others*

The following are causes of vocal abuse and strain:
**Abusing the voice.** In most cases, the number one cause of vocal strain leading to nodules and polyps is abusing the voice in the form of screaming or yelling.
*. Avoid screaming at all cost. That goes for yelling, too.*

* **Don't forget steam.** Steam is great for the vocal cords. Inhale gently when in the shower to bring moisture to the throat. Or, boil water in a pot, remove from the stove and (taking care not to burn your face), inhale the steam. Adding a towel draped over the head during inhalation helps.
* **Avoiding dairy.** Dairy products can produce mucus so go easy on milk, cheese, ice cream and such.
* To avoid throat problems such as polyps and nodules, do not scream and yell.
* **Sharpen your awareness of your stress level.** Muscle pain is often the *end* result of a stress response, so if you notice the beginning of a tension-producer, you can break from it, preventing strain from turning into aches and paralysis. For example, lots of people develop headaches and tired, teary eyes after long days and nights in front of the computer screen. If they took a couple of minutes every half-hour to stop and rest their eyes, they'd likely ward off greater discomfort later on.
