Thanks for the offer of help.  What I have is just this strange heart-lung condition that appears from time to time.  I just have to stay in bed as much as possible, and fight the temptation to get up.  It was aggravated recently by some new meds for another condition, etc. 

I actually pulled out an old book recently that I’ve always appreciated but never finished.  The ideas aren’t new, but I appreciate his concise way of addressing it, as if i were to write a book on chaos magic, this might be it.  So yes, it’s on that topic. 

You know what you say regarding conspiracy culture.  I recently watched a pretty good documentary about a reporter who spent his life investigating the son of Sam murderer, and particularly the underlying conspiracy web that linked such players as the Process church, Hollywood, Manson, etc.  The guy wrote a book on it, a sort of expose.  This was the 70’s.  He recieved a lot of flak because the NYPD wanted the story buried.  

It’d be cool to do a short history of conspiracy theories.  

Conspiracy beliefs are widespread around the world.[47] In rural Africa, common targets of conspiracy theorizing include societal elites, enemy tribes, and the Western world, with conspirators often alleged to enact their plans via sorcery or witchcraft; one common belief identifies modern technology as itself being a form of sorcery, created with the goal of harming or controlling the people

[Jesse Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Walker) (2013) has identified five kinds of conspiracy theories

Four kinds have to do with locating “the enemy” and the fifth kind has to do with locating the source of “the good”, ie, benevolent forces secretly helping society.  

Not mentioned, but I guess another characteristic of conspiracy is the way it counters the meta-narrative:  we’re talking about “secret stuff”.
