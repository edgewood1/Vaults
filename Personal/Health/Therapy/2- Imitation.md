# 2- Imitation


The early chapters of Book One set a foundational tone for the entire work. Here's a summary of the essence of the first 12 chapters, with a key phrase or paraphrase from each (often drawing from common translations like the Challoner or Whitford versions, or paraphrased for clarity) that you can use for meditation:
**Book I: Admonitions Useful for a Spiritual Life**
1. **Chapter 1: Of the Imitation of Christ and Contempt of all the Vanities of the World.**	* **Essence:** True wisdom and happiness are found not in worldly knowledge, possessions, or honors, but in loving and serving God and following Christ's example of humility and detachment from fleeting earthly things.
	* **Meditate on:** "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, except to love God and to serve Him only."
2. **Chapter 2: Of Thinking Humbly of Oneself.**	* **Essence:** Genuine self-knowledge reveals our own weaknesses and sinfulness, leading to humility. We should not esteem ourselves above others, as God's judgment is the true measure.
	* **Meditate on:** "Truly to know oneself is the highest and most useful lesson. To esteem oneself as nothing, and to think always well and highly of others, is great wisdom and perfection." (Paraphrased slightly for flow)
3. **Chapter 3: Of the Doctrine of Truth.**	* **Essence:** God is the ultimate Truth, and true understanding comes from His unmediated teaching within us, not primarily from human opinions or complex debates. A pure conscience and a simple heart are more valuable than profound intellect without virtue.
	* **Meditate on:** "Happy is the one whom Truth teaches by itself, not by fleeting words and images, but as it is in itself."
4. **Chapter 4: Of Prudence in Action (or Of Foresight in our Actions).**	* **Essence:** We should not be quick to believe every word or follow every impulse. Instead, we should carefully and patiently consider matters in the light of God's will, seeking good counsel when needed.
	* **Meditate on:** "Believe not every word or impulse, but cautiously and patiently weigh the matter according to God."
5. **Chapter 5: Of the Reading of Holy Scriptures.**	* **Essence:** Scripture should be read with humility, simplicity, and faith for spiritual profit and to learn truth, not for eloquence, novelty, or to gain a reputation for learning. The spirit in which it was written is the spirit in which it should be understood.
	* **Meditate on:** "In Holy Scripture, truth is to be sought rather than eloquence. Read with humility, simplicity, and faith, and seek not at any time the fame of being learned."
6. **Chapter 6: Of Inordinate Affections (or Unruly Desires).**	* **Essence:** Uncontrolled desires and passions are the source of inner turmoil and restlessness. True peace of heart is found in resisting these passions, not in indulging them.
	* **Meditate on:** "True peace of heart is to be found in resisting passions, not in yielding to them."
7. **Chapter 7: Of Fleeing Vain Hope and Pride.**	* **Essence:** Do not place your trust or hope in yourself, in other people, or in any created thing. All glory and hope should be placed in God alone. Humility protects against the poison of pride.
	* **Meditate on:** "Glory not in riches, if you have them, nor in friends because they are powerful; but in God Who gives all things, and desires to give Himself above all1 things."
8. **Chapter 8: Of Shunning Too Much Familiarity.**	* **Essence:** While charity is important, excessive or indiscriminate social interaction can be a distraction from spiritual focus and inner peace. Meaningful solitude and careful choice of company are beneficial.
	* **Meditate on:** "Open not your heart to every man, but discuss your affairs with one who is wise and fears God."
9. **Chapter 9: Of Obedience and Subjection.**	* **Essence:** Great spiritual security and progress are found in living under obedience to a legitimate superior, thereby dying to one's own will and judgment. It is safer to be in a position of being guided than to be entirely self-directed.
	* **Meditate on:** "It is a very great thing to live in obedience, to be under a superior, and not to be at our own disposal. It is much safer to be in subjection than in authority."
10. **Chapter 10: Of Avoiding Superfluity of Words (or Of Avoiding Much Talk).**	* **Essence:** Guard your speech carefully. Idle chatter, gossip, and excessive talking dissipate spiritual energy, can lead to sin, and rarely occur without some fault. Value silence.
	* **Meditate on:** "Fly the tumult of men as much as you can; for the treating of worldly affairs is a great hindrance, even though it be done with a simple intention."
11. **Chapter 11: Of Acquiring Peace and of Zeal for Spiritual Progress.**	* **Essence:** True peace comes from focusing on our own spiritual improvement and detaching from an excessive interest in the affairs or words of others. Strive for growth, but don't be discouraged by the effort it takes.
	* **Meditate on:** "If you wouldst have peace and true concord, you must set aside, in a great measure, your own will and your own opinion." (Or a more direct paraphrase for this chapter: "Attend to yourself, and be silent about the doings of others, and you will feel little or no disturbance.")
12. **Chapter 12: Of the Advantage of Adversity.**	* **Essence:** Difficulties, trials, and sufferings are spiritually beneficial. They humble us, remind us of our exile in this world, drive us to seek God more earnestly, and help detach us from worldly comforts.
	* **Meditate on:** "It is good for us to encounter troubles and adversities at times, for they often make a man enter into himself, that he may know that he is in exile and place not his hope in anything of the world."
Take one of these summary points and its corresponding meditative phrase each day or each week. Reflect on it, consider how it applies to your thoughts and actions, and ask for the grace to live it out. This is a beautiful practice.

Okay, let's define vanity and look at an example, keeping in mind its usage in texts like *The Imitation of Christ*.
**Definition of Vanity**
Vanity generally has two intertwined meanings:
1. **Excessive pride in or admiration of one's own appearance, abilities, achievements, or possessions; self-conceit.** This is the more common modern understanding. It involves a high degree of self-satisfaction and often a desire for others to admire these qualities.
3. **The quality of being worthless, futile, empty, or insignificant.** This is a deeper, more classical or philosophical meaning, prominent in religious texts (like the famous phrase "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity" from the Book of Ecclesiastes, which *The Imitation of Christ* echoes). It refers to the transience and ultimate lack of substance in worldly pursuits or earthly things when not grounded in something more lasting or spiritual.
In *The Imitation of Christ*, "vanity" often encompasses both aspects: the foolishness of taking pride in things (like worldly knowledge, status, or beauty) that are ultimately fleeting and empty when compared to eternal spiritual values.
**Example of Vanity**
Let's use an example that touches on both aspects, but leans into the first for clarity:
Imagine **a scholar who dedicates their entire life to acquiring obscure knowledge, not primarily for the love of truth or to benefit others, but to be recognized as the most learned person in their field.**
* **Excessive Pride/Self-Conceit Aspect:** They constantly steer conversations to their own expertise, subtly (or not so subtly) belittle the knowledge of others, derive immense satisfaction from academic awards and titles, and feel personally slighted if their intellectual superiority isn't acknowledged. Their primary motivation is to build up their own image and reputation.
* **Futility/Emptiness Aspect (as viewed by Thomas à Kempis):** From the perspective of *The Imitation of Christ*, if this pursuit of knowledge isn't accompanied by humility, love of God, or a desire to serve, it becomes a "vanity." The knowledge, however vast, doesn't lead to true wisdom (which involves knowing God and oneself in relation to God) or lasting happiness. It's a pursuit that, in the grand scheme of spiritual life, is empty because it's self-centered and focused on something (worldly esteem, intellectual prowess for its own sake) that is transient and doesn't contribute to the soul's union with God. The scholar might be brilliant, but if they lack charity or humility, their efforts are seen as vain.
So, the scholar's preoccupation with being seen as brilliant and their emotional investment in that reputation, especially if detached from deeper virtues or service, would be an example of vanity. They are proud of something that, in the context of seeking spiritual depth, is considered relatively empty or fleeting.

It's very human to feel that "pang" in such situations. It often arises from a sense of perceived injustice, wounded pride, perhaps a touch of envy, or the discomfort of feeling undervalued or judged. Let's explore how you might change the way you process these feelings, drawing from the wisdom of *The Imitation of Christ*.
**Understanding the "Pang" and How to Deal with It**
The feelings you describe are common when our expectations of fairness, recognition, or acceptance are not met.
* In the **work scenario**, your sense of competence and perhaps fairness is challenged. You see someone you perceive as less skilled being elevated, which can feel like a personal slight or a systemic error.
* In the 
* **music scenario**, you perceive judgment from someone dedicated to an art form where you feel less accomplished. This can trigger feelings of inadequacy or resentment towards their perceived superiority or critical attitude.
*The Imitation of Christ* would approach these feelings by directing you inward, away from the external circumstances and the actions of others, and towards your own heart and your relationship with God. The core advice would likely revolve around:
1. **Humility:** This is paramount. The book would ask why this "pang" arises. Is it from a desire for worldly esteem, recognition, or a feeling that you *deserve* better than others? True humility finds peace in being overlooked or even disdained by the world, because its value system is different. It encourages you to be "little in your own eyes."
5. **Detachment from Worldly Judgment and Rewards:** Promotions, the good opinion of others, and even perceived skill levels are, in the grand scheme of *The Imitation*, vanities. They are fleeting and not the source of true peace or worth. Your value isn't determined by your job title or another person's assessment of your musical talent.
9. **Focus on Your Own Conscience and God's View:** What matters is not how others see you or how they advance, but how you stand before God and your own conscience. Are you doing your work diligently for a higher purpose? Are you cultivating inner peace regardless of external validation?
11. **Avoiding Judgment of Others:** Regarding the musician, *The Imitation* would gently caution against judging his heart or assuming his intentions. While his manner may be off-putting, you cannot truly know his inner state or the complexities of his own journey. Focus instead on your own reaction.
15. **Patience and Bearing Wrongs Quietly:** The book often speaks of the spiritual benefit of patiently enduring slights, misunderstandings, or what seems unfair. This is seen as an imitation of Christ.
17. **Seeking Interior Peace Above All:** The goal is a tranquil heart, undisturbed by the storms of external events or the opinions of others. This peace is found in God alone.

**A Chapter from** ***The Imitation of Christ*** **Composed for This Emotion**
While many chapters touch on related themes (see below), here is a section composed in the style of *The Imitation of Christ* specifically addressing the "pang" you describe:

**Chapter Title: Of Bearing the Preferment of Others and Enduring Secret Judgment**
1. My child, why art thou disquieted when another is advanced, and thou art seemingly left behind? Or when thou feelest the silent arrow of another's judgment concerning thy talents or thy worth?
2. Know that this pang often springs from a root of pride, or from a secret longing for the esteem of men, which is but wind and smoke. Thou seekest a fairness in the world that the world cannot consistently give, for its ways are not My ways.
3. Consider Me, thy Lord. Did I not walk a path of humility, misunderstood, and often despised? Was I not judged by those who knew little of the Father's will? Yet, My peace was in Him alone.
4. If another is preferred before thee, what is that to thee if thy heart be right with Me? Perhaps I see in thee a strength to bear a lesser place with grace, which is a greater honor in My kingdom than the highest seat in the assembly of men.
5. Or if thou art given a superior who seems less able, fulfill thy part with diligence and humility, not for their approval, but for love of Me, Who seest all thy labor. Murmur not, but pray for them, that they may bear their charge well.
6. And if thou sensest judgment from another, turn not thy mind to judge them in return. Their opinion does not alter what thou art in My sight. If there be any truth in their unspoken censure that may profit thy soul, receive it humbly. If it be mere human frailty, let it pass by thee as a breeze that rustles the leaves but does not shake the tree.
7. Seek not to justify thyself before men, for often the more thou dost so, the more entangled thou becomest. Commit thy cause to Me; I am a just judge and know the secrets of all hearts.
8. Let thy peace not rest on the breath of men, nor on the shifting sands of worldly success. Anchor thy heart in Me, and no such pang shall long disturb thy soul. Be content to be unknown, or even misjudged, if only thou hast My approval. For to be little in thine own eyes, and in the eyes of the world, is often to be great in Mine.

**Essence of This Chapter:**
The discomfort you feel when others are preferred, or when you perceive judgment, often arises from pride and a reliance on worldly validation. True peace and self-worth are found in humility, focusing on God's estimation of you rather than human opinions or advancements, and patiently bearing perceived slights or injustices for His sake.
**Item to Meditate On:**
"Let My judgment of thee be thy peace, and be thou little in thine own eyes."
**Related Existing Chapters in** ***The Imitation of Christ***
Several existing chapters in *The Imitation of Christ* resonate strongly with the feelings you've described:
* **Book I, Chapter 2: Of Thinking Humbly of Oneself.** This is foundational.
* **Book I, Chapter 7: Of Fleeing Vain Hope and Pride.** Your desire for recognition and the sting of being overlooked relate to this.
* **Book I, Chapter 9: Of Obedience and Subjection.** This speaks to accepting authority, even if imperfectly administered.
* **Book I, Chapter 14: Of Avoiding Rash Judgment.** Relevant to your feelings about the musician.
* **Book I, Chapter 16: Of Bearing with the Defects of Others.****Book II, Chapter 1: Of Inward Conversation.** (Focusing on the internal rather than external).
* **Book III, Chapter 40: That Man Hath No Good of Himself Whereof He Can Glory.** This speaks to abilities and achievements.
By meditating on these principles and the composed passage, the aim is to gradually shift your internal response, finding a more profound and stable peace that isn't dependent on external circumstances or the approval of others.

Okay, let's break down that phrase concisely:
**"Let My judgment of thee be thy peace, and be thou little in thine own eyes."**
* **"Let My judgment of thee be thy peace..."**:
	* "My" refers to **God's** judgment.
	* This means: Find your inner calm, sense of worth, and security not in what other people think of you, nor in your own often fluctuating or critical self-assessment, but in how 
	* **God** sees and values you. If you believe God's view of you is loving, merciful, and true, that understanding should be the source of your peace.
* **"...and be thou little in thine own eyes."**:
	* This means: Practice **humility**. Don't have an inflated or overly important view of yourself, your talents, or your achievements.
	* This part reinforces the first: if you are humble and not overly focused on your own perceived greatness or failings, it's easier to accept God's judgment as the true measure and find peace in that, rather than being disturbed by worldly comparisons or ego.
**In essence:** Your peace should come from **God's** loving and true understanding of who you are, not from human opinions or your own pride. Cultivate humility.
