Practices

<u>**Topic 1: the appearance of excess work in limited time.**</u>
History: often don’t work as often due to fatigue.

How to setup and understand where I am in my life - 
How to set up realistic ways to go into different projects. 
I’m spending too much time? 
It may take longer and I can still finish and meet deadlines.

What set of habits can i do before a work session
Checkin: where am I at, what am I feeling, what does the day look like for me? 
Due 23 June - what are the steps // motivate - 

1. Review CDs, and ways to identify if I’m going down the path, like self-imposed deadlines, catrophic 
2. Habit: checklist, listen to music.

Cognitive Distortions
1. Catastrophe - 10 things to do in 2 hours; things will explode
2. Should statements - this should not be happening
3. Blame

Questions
1. Self-imposed timeline - do I really need to finish in 2 hours? Can I talk to someone about this deadline?  Challenge the deadline to avoid pressure.
2. Self-image: will people really see me as a poor programmer due to this? Do you really show a pattern of this? And even if I do, the manager and I would likely explore a resolution.  

Actions
- Relax. Breathe. (Breathing slows thoughts)
- Affirmation: 

Abandoning things - “the thread”
-  How can I spearhead / be the project manager. 

Will check-ins be overwhelming.. if they are not getting done?
* if they don’t meet the value… can I be accepting that it doesn’t happen.
* We allow the abandon when we don’t do the follow-up.

<u>**Topic 2: Playing music around seasoned musicians**</u>
History: certain genres, I’m less experienced in. 
Feeling - insecure

Cognitive Distortions

Solution
- Happy to be getting to play with other people.

<u>**Topic 3: Work - being productive**</u>
* we have a deadline and a lot of work to do before then. This time it’s not a self-imposed deadline.  My reaction was to blame the lead due to a few past decisions.  Also she has a history of these decisions and mistakes.  For a moment, I wanted to walk away from the situation because there was so much to do. 

My perception of lead
* Disqualifying the positive: she has good qualities
* should statements: people can not always predict the consequence of decisions. 

My perception of the work (there’s too muc)
* Personalitzation
* Catastrophic: 

Cognitive Distortion
Dont blame - it wastes time because i have to get myself away from that & it heats me up.

<u>**Topic 4: workflow - I stayed up later because I had a good idea that I wanted to work out**</u>
Solutions
* Write down the great idea; I will be here 2 days - so what’s the rush to get it done?

Everyone will be watching this: 
* how to incorporate pairing more?
