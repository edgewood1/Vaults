# How a CBT Thought Record Works:

**1. Situation:**
The individual describes the specific situation that triggered a negative thought or emotion.

**2. Automatic Thought:**
They record the immediate, often automatic, thought that came to mind in that situation.

**3. Emotions:**
The individual identifies and rates the intensity of the emotions associated with the thought.

**4. Evidence:**
They list the evidence that supports the automatic thought and then the evidence that contradicts it.

1.  **Alternative Thought:**The individual develops a more balanced or rational alternative thought that incorporates the evidence from both sides.
3. **Outcome:**They re-rate their emotions after considering the alternative thought, noting any changes in intensity.
