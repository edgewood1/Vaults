# AM - kathy


I asked how I could help her

Started making sandwich and explaining how we can have greater bonding

She is irate, non-responsive.  We talk about that and it grows into an argument - 

Why is she so tense? Bc she does’no want to forget
Then why not use a list? 
If it’s the both of us, and we’re communicating, we don’t even need a list
This refusal to share / communicate not helpful
I don’t want to help if this is creating a destructive morning for everyone involved, including fina - it’s better she stay home then experience this. 
Then she makes it worse by taking time out of what she’s almost done to yell that she needs help - 
Then i have to explain to Fina what’s happening. 
Ya’ll leave without saying good bye and no idea where Roscoe is with things.
