# Issue: sister


Should I contact my sister? 
1. There are two ways of connecting: physical and psychically. 
2. They are equivalent. 
3. I could contact her psychically, by sending positive healing sentiment. 

When I get antipathy about this partial mode of contact? 
1. I direct it at her husband for contributing & relate it to more negativity.
2. But I am the one who opted for this. 

Previous problem
1. She is nice in person, but there’s is underlying prejudgment that sometimes comes out when we are in person. 
2. Since we can’t address the prejudice, can we address when it comes out as weirdness? 
3. Do i want to be sweet with someone who is like that? 
4. does her assumption affect her behavior? 

What is the psychic approach? 
1. the power of healing wash is that it overcomes all that counters it; and so the presence of antipathy, while warranted, is undone by the wash.  

Also, antipathy only hurts me, so the wash towards them is as fully a wash for myself, a means of protecting me and my family from the psychic attacks that motivate the antipathy. 

Thus, I send love towards the whole family, and this could be a  mantra. 

The comparison to the fraternity is strong.  
1. Their misbehavior can lead to issues for myself, but only if i fall into it.  The wash takes care of myself, and allows me to be clear about: 
2. Despite this psychic move, I need to take physical steps to address their behavior.   They are not ignored.
