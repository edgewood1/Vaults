Common cognitive distortions mentioned in Dr. David D. Burns in "Feeling Good"

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking (or Black-and-White Thinking)**	* **Definition:** This distortion involves viewing situations, people, or yourself in absolute, extreme terms. Everything falls into one of two opposite categories – perfect or terrible, success or failure, good or bad – with no room for nuance, shades of gray, or partial successes. If something falls short of perfect, you see it as a total failure.
	* **How it differs:** This distortion focuses on judging a *single* event, characteristic, or outcome in extreme terms, rather than generalizing one event to predict future ones (Overgeneralization) or filtering out positive aspects of a situation (Mental Filter).
	* **Examples:**"I didn't get the top score on the exam, so I'm a complete failure as a student." (Anything less than perfect is seen as total failure).
		* "If I eat one piece of cake, my entire diet is ruined, and I might as well give up." (A single deviation invalidates all effort).
2. **Overgeneralization**	* **Definition:** You take a single negative event or piece of evidence and conclude that it represents a never-ending pattern of defeat or negativity. If something bad happens once, you expect it to happen over and over again. Words like "always," "never," "everybody," or "nobody" often signal this distortion.
	* **How it differs:** Unlike All-or-Nothing thinking which judges *one* instance harshly, Overgeneralization uses *one* instance to make a broad, negative prediction about the *future* or *all* similar situations. It differs from Mental Filter because it's about projecting a pattern, not just focusing on the negative within one specific situation.
	* **Examples:**"I got turned down for a date. I'll *always* be alone; *nobody* will ever want to go out with me." (One rejection is generalized into a belief about all future possibilities).
		* "I made a mistake during that presentation. I 
		* *never* do anything right at work." (A single error is seen as evidence of perpetual incompetence).
3. **Mental Filter (or Selective Abstraction)**	* **Definition:** This involves picking out a single negative detail in a situation and dwelling on it exclusively, thereby filtering out all the positive aspects. Your vision of reality becomes darkened, like wearing sunglasses that block out anything positive.
	* **How it differs:** Mental Filter is about selectively focusing on the negative *within* a specific situation or experience, ignoring concurrent positives. It's different from All-or-Nothing because the overall situation might not be judged as a total failure, but the *focus* is solely on the negative element. It differs from Overgeneralization because it's about ignoring positives *in the present moment or a specific past event*, rather than using one event to predict a negative future pattern.
	* **Examples:**You receive numerous compliments on a project report, but one colleague points out a minor statistical error. You obsess over the error and feel the entire report was bad, ignoring all the praise. (Filtering out the positive feedback).
		* You have a pleasant evening out with friends, but you dwell on one awkward comment you made early on, concluding the whole night was a disaster despite enjoying most of it. (Ignoring hours of enjoyment to focus on one brief negative moment).
These three distortions often work together, but understanding their distinct mechanisms – extreme judgment (All-or-Nothing), pattern prediction (Overgeneralization), and selective focus (Mental Filter) – is key to identifying and challenging them.

1. **Disqualifying the Positive**	* **Definition:** This distortion involves acknowledging positive experiences, qualities, or feedback but actively rejecting them by insisting they "don't count" for some reason.1 You transform a neutral or positive experience into a negative one.
	* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** Unlike **Mental Filter** (which simply ignores or fails to notice positives), Disqualifying the Positive *actively neutralizes* or negates positives that *are* perceived. It's not **All-or-Nothing Thinking** because you might not see the whole situation as bad, just that the *good parts are invalid*. It's not **Overgeneralization** (predicting future patterns) or **Jumping to Conclusions**(assuming thoughts/outcomes). Its unique signature is the *active dismissal* of specific positive evidence.2
	* **Examples:**"I completed the project successfully, but that doesn't count because anyone could have done it; it was just luck." (Acknowledges success but invalidates it).
		* "You say I look nice today, but you're just being kind; you don't really mean it." (Acknowledges the compliment but dismisses its sincerity or validity).
2. Jumping to Conclusions
3. This distortion involves making negative interpretations or predictions without definite facts to support your conclusion. It has two main subtypes:
	* **a) Mind Reading:****Definition:** You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you or thinking negatively about you, without bothering to check if it's true.3
		* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** This is uniquely focused on assuming knowledge of *other people's specific thoughts or intentions*, usually negative ones directed at you, without evidence. It's distinct from **Fortune Telling** (predicting future events), **Personalization** (taking general events as personally directed or blaming oneself), **Overgeneralization** (predicting patterns based on one event), or **Emotional Reasoning** (basing conclusions on feelings). The core is the *unsubstantiated assumption about another's mind*.
		* **Examples:**"My boss didn't smile when I passed her in the hall. She must be angry with me about my report." (Assuming negative thoughts based on ambiguous non-verbal cues).
			* "He hasn't called me back yet. He probably thinks I'm boring and doesn't want to talk to me again." (Assuming negative judgment without knowing the reason for the delay).
	* **b) Fortune Telling:****Definition:** You anticipate that things will turn out badly and are convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact, often preventing you from taking action.
		* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** This is uniquely focused on predicting a *specific negative future outcome* as if it were certain, without sufficient evidence. It differs from **Overgeneralization**, which extends a *past* pattern, while Fortune Telling might predict a negative outcome even for a novel situation. It's not **Mind Reading** (about others' thoughts), **Catastrophizing** (which exaggerates the *impact* of a potential negative outcome, while Fortune Telling predicts the outcome *itself*), or **Emotional Reasoning** (basing prediction on feelings). The core is the *certainty of a specific negative future*.
		* **Examples:**"I know I'll fail the interview, so there's no point in preparing too much." (Predicting failure as a fact before the event).
			* "If I try to start this business, it's definitely going to go bankrupt within a year." (Predicting a negative future outcome with certainty).
4. **Magnification (Catastrophizing) and Minimization**	* **Definition:** You exaggerate the importance or magnitude of negative things (your mistakes, someone else's achievements – **Magnification** or **Catastrophizing**) or inappropriately shrink or downplay positive things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or achievements, others' imperfections – **Minimization**).
	* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** The unique feature is the *distortion of scale or significance*. It's not just filtering (Mental Filter) or disqualifying positives (Disqualifying the Positive), but actively *inflating*negatives or *deflating* positives. Unlike **All-or-Nothing**, which assigns absolute categories (good/bad), Magnification/Minimization operates on a distorted continuum of importance. It differs from **Fortune Telling** because it focuses on the *perceived impact* or *size* of something (past, present, or future), not just predicting a negative outcome.
	* **Examples:**(Magnification/Catastrophizing): "I made a small typo in the email to the client. This is a disaster! They'll think I'm incompetent, and we'll lose the account." (Blowing a small error out of proportion).
		* (Minimization): "Yes, I got promoted, but it's really not a big deal; my role hasn't changed that much." (Downplaying a significant achievement).
5. **Emotional Reasoning**	* **Definition:** You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are. You essentially take your feelings as evidence for objective truth.
	* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** Its unique characteristic is the reliance on *internal emotional states* as the primary *proof* for an external reality or a judgment about oneself/others. All other distortions involve specific types of faulty *thinking* patterns about events, evidence, or predictions. Emotional Reasoning bypasses logic and evidence, directly equating *feeling* with *fact*.4
	* **Examples:**"I feel overwhelmed and anxious, so my problems must be impossible to solve." (Feeling becomes proof of the situation's hopelessness).
		* "I feel guilty, therefore I must have done something wrong." (Guilt is taken as evidence of actual wrongdoing, regardless of facts).
6. **Should Statements (Musts, Oughts)**	* **Definition:** You operate based on rigid, internalized rules about how you and others *should*, *must*, or *ought to* behave. When directed inward, they lead to guilt and self-criticism. When directed outward towards others or the world, they lead to anger, frustration, and resentment.
	* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** The unique feature is the focus on *violating implicit or explicit rules or expectations*. It's not necessarily about evaluating a situation in extremes (All-or-Nothing), predicting patterns (Overgeneralization), or assuming thoughts (Mind Reading). The core problem lies in the *imposition of inflexible demands* on reality and the resulting emotional fallout when those demands aren't met.
	* **Examples:**"I *should* always be productive; I wasted the whole afternoon, which is terrible." (Applying a rigid rule to oneself, leading to guilt).
		* "He 
		* *shouldn't* have driven so slowly in front of me! People *ought to* know better." (Applying a rule to others, leading to anger/frustration).
7. **Labeling and Mislabeling**	* **Definition:** This is an extreme form of Overgeneralization. Instead of describing a specific error or behavior, you attach a negative, global, and often emotionally loaded label to yourself or someone else. Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.
	* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** Its unique aspect is the creation of a *totalizing, static, negative identity*based on one or more behaviors or mistakes. It's more extreme than **Overgeneralization** (which sees a pattern but might not create a fixed identity label). It's different from **All-or-Nothing** because it applies a global *label* ("I am a fool") rather than just evaluating a single performance as a "failure." It's distinct from other distortions by its focus on *defining* someone's entire being by negative actions or traits.
	* **Examples:**Instead of "I made a mistake on that calculation," you think, "I'm such an idiot." (Applying a global negative label to oneself).
		* Instead of "He didn't agree with my suggestion," you think, "He's a complete jerk." (Applying a global negative label to someone else based on a specific disagreement).
8. **Personalization**	* **Definition:** You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which, in fact, you were not primarily responsible for. Or, you5 interpret general negative events as being directed specifically at you.
	* **How it Differs (Uniquely):** The unique core is the *erroneous assumption of causality or blame directed towards oneself*. It's distinct from **Mind Reading** (assuming thoughts, not blame), **Fortune Telling** (predicting the future), **Labeling** (applying negative traits), or **Should Statements** (about rules). Personalization specifically involves incorrectly linking external negative events to oneself as either the *cause* or the intended *target*.6
	* **Examples:**A parent sees their child's bad report card and thinks, "This shows what a bad parent I am." (Taking primary responsibility for the child's performance).
		* Your colleague seems moody at work, and you immediately think, "I must have done something to upset her." (Assuming you are the cause of someone else's unrelated mood).
Understanding these distinct patterns is the first step toward recognizing them in your own thoughts and challenging their validity.
