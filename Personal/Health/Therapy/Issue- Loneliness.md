# Issue: Loneliness

**1. The Psalms**

The **Book of Psalms** is a powerful starting place. Many were written in times of isolation, sorrow, or abandonment, and they speak honestly to God about these feelings.
	•	**Psalm 22:** “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Even Jesus prayed this on the cross — it shows that crying out in loneliness is not a lack of faith, but a deep part of it.)
	•	**Psalm 34:18:** “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted; he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.”
	•	**Psalm 139:** A beautiful affirmation that God is always near and intimately aware of your life.

You might consider praying one psalm each day, slowly and reflectively, even journaling your own version after reading it.

**2. The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis**

This classic devotional book is deeply contemplative, focusing on the inner life and communion with Christ, especially in suffering and abandonment. It’s written in a direct, accessible style (especially modern translations) and reminds you that you can always turn inward toward Christ when outward support is lacking.

**3. Letters from St. Mother Teresa**

Books like *Come Be My Light* contain personal letters where Mother Teresa confides her own long spiritual loneliness — often referred to as a “dark night.” Her unwavering belief in Jesus’ presence in the midst of it can be incredibly comforting.

**4. Writings of St. John of the Cross**

If you’re open to slightly more poetic, contemplative reading, *The Dark Night of the Soul* is a profound exploration of spiritual desolation and the hidden closeness of God during those times.

**5. Healing the Lonely Heart by Fr. John Bartunek**

This is a newer, more accessible resource specifically designed to address emotional and spiritual loneliness from a Catholic perspective. Fr. Bartunek writes in a compassionate, practical tone.

**6. Daily Devotionals and Apps**

You might benefit from daily guidance through resources like:
	•	**Magnificat** (monthly spiritual guide)
	•	**Hallow app** (audio-guided Catholic prayer and meditation — especially good for when you feel too exhausted to read)

**Core Message**

The heart of Catholic teaching is the Incarnation — *God with us*. Jesus entered into isolation, rejection, and suffering so we would never be alone in ours. The Church is also the Body of Christ, and while people can fail us, this truth remains: **you are not alone.**
