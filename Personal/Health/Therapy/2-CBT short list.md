**Distortions**
1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White Thinking)**  
   Viewing situations in absolute extremes (perfect or failure), leaving no room for nuance.

1. **Overgeneralization**  
   Using one negative event to predict a broad, unending pattern of failure or negativity.

1. **Mental Filter (Selective Abstraction)**  
   Focusing exclusively on a single negative detail while ignoring the broader positive context.

1. **Disqualifying the Positive**  
   Actively rejecting or invalidating positive experiences or feedback as not counting.

1. **Jumping to Conclusions**  
   Making negative assumptions without evidence, either about what others think (*Mind Reading*) or what will happen (*Fortune Telling*).  
* **Mind Reading**: Assuming others are thinking negatively about you without any proof.  
* **Fortune Telling**: Predicting negative outcomes as if they’re inevitable facts.

1. **Magnification (Catastrophizing) and Minimization**  
   Exaggerating the importance of negatives or downplaying the significance of positives.

1. **Emotional Reasoning**  
   Believing that negative feelings reflect objective reality (“I feel it, so it must be true”).

1. **Should Statements (Musts, Oughts)**  
   Imposing rigid, unrealistic rules on yourself or others, leading to guilt or frustration.

1. **Labeling and Mislabeling**  
   Attaching global, negative labels to yourself or others based on specific behaviors.

1. **Personalization**  
    Taking excessive responsibility for events outside your control or seeing them as directed at you.
