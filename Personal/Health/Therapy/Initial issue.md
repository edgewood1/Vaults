# Initial issue


Hi Michael,
My primary concern right now revolves around managing frustration and anger, specifically when triggered by my wife. This isn't a daily occurrence, but it happens frequently, perhaps every couple of weeks. It often seems tied to recurring themes that I thought were resolved, which exacerbates the issue.

Lately, this emotional pattern has begun to have significant physical effects. The frustration escalates into anger, which I now feel as noticeable tension and discomfort in my chest and heart area. I've noticed my blood pressure has been elevated over the past few weeks, which I strongly suspect is linked to this stress and emotional intensity.

My main goal is to learn how to not be so easily triggered, by my wife and ideally by others as well. I am becoming genuinely concerned that continuing this cycle of frustration and anger could negatively impact my long-term physical health.

I've studied CBT in the past and found it helpful; I would like to return to using CBT principles to address these triggers and my reactions.

Additionally, I've realized that sometimes when I get passionate or intense in conversation, even that physical act of speaking forcefully seems to contribute to the chest discomfort. I'd like to explore ways to communicate in a more subdued or modulated tone without suppressing what I need to say.

Deep breathing exercises have been very helpful for managing immediate tension, and I want to incorporate more effective coping strategies like this.

I'm looking for a structured approach that I can work on over time, with your guidance and support as my therapist.

I apologize that I won't be able to talk through all of this in detail verbally tomorrow, but I hope this gives you a clear picture of my current struggles and goals for our work together.
Thank you,
Mel DeJesus

**Potential Next Steps - As If I Were Your Therapist (Hypothetical)**

1. **Learn to identify patterns**


**Deepen Understanding of the Cycle:** Even with limited speaking, we can begin to map out the cycle you've described.
	* What are the *specific* recurring themes?   They are generalizations, or statements that include overlook points.  
	* Can we identify patterns in the 
	* *types* of situations or topics that trigger you?
	* What are your 
	* *initial thoughts* when you start feeling triggered? (This is where CBT comes in).
	* What are the 
	* *physical sensations* you notice first, before the full chest tension sets in?
	* What are your 
	* *automatic reactions* or behaviors?

**Re-engage with CBT Principles:** Since you have prior experience, we can build on that foundation. We'll likely focus on:
1. **Identifying Trigger Situations.**
2. **identify my common thinking errors that occur in triggering situations:**
3.  (like mind-reading, catastrophizing, all-or-nothing thinking) that might be fueling your frustration and anger.
	* "She's doing this on purpose," "This will never change," "I can't believe we're back here").
	* My own generalization: She always does this.
	* Catastrophe: that’s unfair!
	* Mindreading: She thinks I’m X!
	* That’s completely irrational and unacceptable!

**3. Developing Alternative Thoughts:** Practicing generating more balanced or realistic perspectives during difficult moments.


**Emotional Regulation Skills:** You mentioned deep breathing helps – that's fantastic! We can expand on this and explore other techniques to manage intense emotions in the moment, such as:
	* **Mindfulness:** Paying attention to your breath, body sensations, and surroundings without judgment to stay present and grounded.
	* **Grounding Techniques:** Using your five senses to connect with the present moment when feeling overwhelmed.
	* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Systematically tensing and releasing muscle groups to reduce physical tension.

**Communication Style Adjustment:** Let's specifically address the passionate speaking issue. This isn't about becoming emotionless, but finding a way to express yourself effectively without physically straining yourself. We can practice:
	* **Mindful Speaking:** Paying attention to your tone, volume, and pace.
	* **Taking Pauses:** Giving yourself space to breathe and regulate during potentially heated discussions.
	* **Assertive Communication:** Learning to express your needs, feelings, and boundaries clearly and respectfully, which can sometimes reduce the *need* for intense delivery.

**Problem-Solving Recurring Themes:** Once you have better awareness and regulation skills, we can work on the *content* of the recurring conflicts with your wife. This might involve:
	* Identifying the underlying needs or concerns on both sides.
	* Developing strategies for discussing these topics more constructively.
	* Potentially involving your wife in some sessions down the line, if appropriate and agreed upon, to work on communication patterns together (though the initial focus should be on 
	* *your* response).

**Developing a Sustainable Plan:** Our work together will be about creating a set of tools and strategies you can use consistently. This might involve:
	* Setting small, achievable goals between sessions.
	* <u>Tracking your progress and challenges.</u><u>Building a "toolbox" of coping skills you can draw from.</u>
	* Planning for potential setbacks – learning what to do when you *do* get triggered.

Generalization 

All or nothing - a type of generalization.  I failed the test, so I am dumb.  

Overgeneralization - a single event as a never-ending pattern of defeat;  a bird poos on your car: they always Pooh on your car.  I failed this test; i always fail a test.  

Mental filter - pick out a single negative detail, and dwell on it: a person says something ugly, so humanity is cruel.  Focus on incorrect things even though a minority
