What prevents you from fully loving everyone that enters your consciousness? 

What does fully loving them mean? Showing these figments of consciousness unconditional love so that I can think about their representations clearly.  

It does not mean having to take action towards them.

1. They have their own life-directions to pursue
2. They have the free will to pursue any of these directions just like I do
3. Just like i should, they should be encouraged and their accomplishments applauded. 
4. Just like towards me, their health should be prayed for: finding ideological nuetrality & not becoming sick. 
5. Who my dad talks with or interacts with or how is no concern of mine - he has free will.  
6. I can call him daily if i want, but i don’t enjoy talking to him, so it’s actually of benefit that he has these connections with others.

We are in fight / flight mode from percieved threats
What is not a threat
* the behavior of others
* The lack of time
* The disorganization of a room. 
* the disorganized state of events

Take a deep breath
Create an organized space of my own
Find love there. 

Mantra
I trust in god’s healing properties that sets all right

work
* I’m in the service of others
* I have good tasks and am respected
* The behavior of others is not my concern
