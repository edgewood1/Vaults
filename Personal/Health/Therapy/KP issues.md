# KP issues



1. Her job is way easier than mine
2. I have health issues that make mine harder
3. My health issues are made worse by past fights with her. 
4. Fina’s trauma the result of witnessing fights. 
5. Fina’s trauma makes it harder for me to work and communication with her in general
6. Fights are incessant despite stating the negative effects repeatedly. 
7. It seems that fights are the constant. 
8. They disrupt creative processes and collaborative opportunity and thus social community. 
9. Because she has an easier job than mine, she can take fina to places, but because of her complaint about that i feel obligated to contribute more which causes me to lose on work. 
10. I’m consistent with violin, but what has kathy been consistent with? Putting fina to sleep? What’s the lesson there when that’s also a struggle without lessons unless i show up, which keeps me from work. 
11. Taking her to extracurricular seems to get in the way of homework, which means that this extra contribution is actually a distraction, and if that outing stopped she’d likely view it as punishment related to homework, and this itself would likely not resolve the fights around homework.  
12. In general, i find myself repeating the same message and due to the endlessness of that, i do get frustrated way to often, and that gets pointed at as further reason why I should not be listened to, creating an endless spiral.
