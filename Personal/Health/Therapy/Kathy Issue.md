# Kathy Issue


1. If a teacher explain something to the student, and asks them to do something, but the student can’t understand the explanation or request, then the teacher gets angry at the student for not understanding. 
2. Then the teacher spends the rest of the school day not communicating with the class except to answer simple questions. 
3. When the student gets frustrated by this, then the other students get blame the student. 


When the abuser attacks the abused, and then the abused sides with the abuser when someone else speaks out against it.
