# Supine hypertension


what does it mean that my blood pressure goes up to 140 when I'm laying down, especially my back, but sitting up is 125 or standing is 120 systolic?
## 

When your blood pressure is 140 systolic (top number) while lying down, but 125 or 120 systolic when sitting or standing, you may have supine hypertension. This means your blood pressure is high specifically when you are in a supine (lying down) position, often on your back. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
What is Supine Hypertension?
* Supine hypertension is a condition where your blood pressure is elevated while lying down, typically defined as a systolic pressure of 140 mmHg or higher and a diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or higher. 
* It's also sometimes referred to as nocturnal hypertension, as blood pressure tends to be higher during the night. 
* This can be a sign of underlying issues with your autonomic nervous system (which regulates blood pressure). 
What Causes Supine Hypertension?
* Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction: The autonomic nervous system can sometimes fail to regulate blood pressure effectively in different body positions. 
* Other Factors:
	* Sleep Apnea: This condition can cause fluctuations in blood pressure, including supine hypertension. 
	* Medications: Certain medications, like some beta-blockers or antidepressants, can contribute to supine hypertension. 
	* Orthostatic Hypotension: A related condition where blood pressure drops when you stand up, can also be present with supine hypertension. 
	* Chronic Kidney Disease: This can impact blood pressure regulation. 
	* Obesity: Excess weight can put strain on the cardiovascular system. 
Why Does it Matter?
* Supine hypertension is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications. 
* It's important to monitor your blood pressure in different positions to get a complete picture of your cardiovascular health. 
What Should You Do?
* Consult Your Doctor: If you are experiencing supine hypertension, it's important to see your doctor to get a proper diagnosis and discuss appropriate treatment options. 
* Lifestyle Modifications: Depending on the cause, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, such as diet, exercise, and weight management, to help regulate your blood pressure. 
* Medications: If lifestyle changes are not enough, medication may be prescribed to lower your blood pressure. 
* Be Consistent with Monitoring: Take your blood pressure regularly and keep a log of your readings to track any changes and patterns.

I’m not especially overweight - at most probably by 10 pounds. I also take armour thyroid. My blood pressure seems to rise almost immediately after laying down and then drop almost immediately after standing. if i lay on my chest and breathe deeply through my back i can cause the blood pressure to drop to standing levels, but it’s less easy to do this on my back.

It's interesting that you've noticed a correlation between your blood pressure, body position, and breathing. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and why it's important to discuss with your doctor: 
Possible Contributing Factors:
* Supine Hypertension and Autonomic Dysfunction: As previously discussed, supine hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure when lying down, especially on your back. This can be a sign of issues with the autonomic nervous system, which regulates blood pressure.
* Armour Thyroid: While Armour Thyroid is a medication for hypothyroidism, it's important to note that thyroid function and blood pressure are interconnected. It's possible that the medication or your thyroid hormone levels might be playing a role, and your doctor can help assess that.
* Body Position and Breathing: The fact that your blood pressure seems to respond to specific body positions and breathing techniques suggests a potential connection to the way these factors influence blood flow, venous return, and intrathoracic pressure.
* Deep Breathing: Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can have a relaxing effect on the nervous system and may also improve venous return, potentially contributing to the observed drop in blood pressure when you breathe deeply through your back. 
Why It's Important to Discuss with Your Doctor:
* Comprehensive Assessment: Your doctor will likely want to do a thorough assessment, including checking your thyroid hormone levels, evaluating your blood pressure in different positions, and discussing your symptoms and medications.
* Medication Review: It's important to review your Armour Thyroid dosage and ensure it's optimized for your individual needs, as too much or too little thyroid hormone can affect blood pressure.
* Exploring Potential Causes: Your doctor can help determine if other factors, such as sleep apnea or autonomic dysfunction, are contributing to your supine hypertension.
* Personalized Management Plan: Based on the assessment, your doctor can develop a personalized plan that might include lifestyle modifications, medication adjustments, or other therapies to manage your blood pressure effectively. 
Important Considerations:
* Self-Management: While deep breathing exercises can be a helpful tool, it's essential to use them as part of a broader management plan, not as a substitute for medical advice.
* Long-Term Monitoring: Regular blood pressure monitoring, both at home and at your doctor's office, is crucial for tracking your progress and identifying any changes. 
It's commendable that you're actively involved in understanding your body and noticing these patterns. Sharing this information with your doctor will help them provide the best possible care for you.

what sort of treatment is typically offered for this condition?







Typical treatment for supine hypertension involves a combination of lifestyle modifications and, in some cases, medications. 
Non-Pharmacological Approaches:
* Head-Up Sleeping: Elevating the head of the bed by 6-9 inches (15-23 cm) can help reduce supine hypertension by promoting venous pooling below the level of the heart and reducing renal hyper-perfusion.
* Avoiding Supine Position: During the day, minimizing or avoiding the supine position, especially for prolonged periods or after taking medications for orthostatic hypotension, can be beneficial.
* Bedtime Snack: A high-carbohydrate snack before bed can induce mild postprandial hypotension, which may help lower blood pressure.
* Fluid and Salt Management:
	* Fluid Intake: Maintaining adequate hydration is important, but it's generally advised to avoid excessive fluid intake in the evening to reduce nocturnal diuresis.
	* Salt Intake: Salt restriction may be recommended if supine hypertension is severe and orthostatic hypotension is not a major concern.
* Medication Timing: Reviewing the timing of medications, particularly those for orthostatic hypotension, and ensuring the last dose is taken at least 3-4 hours before bedtime, can help manage supine hypertension.
* Compression Garments: If orthostatic hypotension is present, compression garments can be beneficial, but they should be removed before lying down to avoid exacerbating supine hypertension. 
Pharmacological Treatments:
* Short-Acting Antihypertensives: If non-pharmacological measures are insufficient, short-acting antihypertensive medications may be prescribed to be taken at bedtime.
	* Examples: <u>[Losartan](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7943503/)</u>, <u>[nitroglycerin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7943503/)</u>, <u>[clonidine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7943503/)</u>, <u>[nifedipine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7943503/)</u>.
* Individualized Therapy: The choice of medication and dosage is highly individualized and should be determined in consultation with a doctor.
* Monitoring: Regular blood pressure monitoring, including at home and with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), can help assess the effectiveness of treatment and make adjustments as needed. 
Important Considerations:
* Balancing Orthostatic Hypotension and Supine Hypertension: If orthostatic hypotension is also present, treatment strategies need to carefully balance the need to manage both conditions, as interventions for one may worsen the other.
* Cautious Medication Use: Patients with autonomic failure, particularly those with multiple system atrophy (MSA), may be more sensitive to the effects of medications, so careful titration and monitoring are essential.
