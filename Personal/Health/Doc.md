Weeks ago 
 * 7: Left testicle contracted.
 * 5: kallianos started 4-week course of antibiotics
 * 1: (after antibiotics finished): Symptoms persisted/worsened slightly; hesitant to jog. Sonar revealed a small cyst in the groin/scrotal area. No follow-up on cyst.
 * Yesterday: Developed a throbbing ache in the upper left shoulder/chest area.
 * This morning: Felt a sharp pain in the groin area above the penis upon touch (new symptom).
 * Today (current): Experiencing trouble staying on feet; shoulder and groin pain feel interrelated.

- Epididymis > vas deferens 
Prostrate check?
- What’s up with cyst? It’s likely worse. 
- Why didn’t the antibiotics work. Probably not an infection?
- Sharp pain in groin + shoulder.  Connection?
- General malaise 
- Can’t stay on my feet long or exercise.  Fever coming on?
- What plans?
- Blood test?
- urine sample?
- See someone else?
