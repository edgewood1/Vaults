The drywall pieces already drilled in could just be spackled, I belive. 

For the floating pieces, we could just add some support, maybe drill a piece of wood into the existing studs, or create a floating backer with a piece of plywood, drilling it into the undamaged drywall from the front, and attaching the new drywall patch to that with screws.
