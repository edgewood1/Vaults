# Magic


**Setup**
 * Shuffle cards.
 * Each player takes 7 cards.
 * Life: Start at 20.

**Turn 1 (The Start)**
 * Draw: Pick up one card.
 * Land Phase:
   * Play 1 Land card (Straight Up).
   * Rule: You can only play 1 land per turn.
 * Action:
   * Check your hand. Do you have a creature that costs 1?
   * No? (Bear costs 2). You don't have enough Land yet.
 * End: Say "Pass."

**Turn 2 (The Build Up)**
 * Untap: (Nothing to untap yet).
 * Draw: Pick up one card.
 * Land Phase:
   * Play 1 Land card (Straight Up).
   * Now you have 2 Lands on the table!
 * Buying Phase:
   * Tap your 2 Lands (turn sideways) to pay for the Bear.
   * Put Bear on table.
   * Rule: Bear is Dizzy (Summoning Sickness). He cannot attack yet.
 * End: Say "Pass."

**Turn 3 (The Battle)**
 * Untap: Turn your 2 Lands straight up (Recharge batteries).
 * Draw: Pick up one card.
 * Land Phase: Play a 3rd Land if you have one.
 * Attack Phase:
   * Tap the Creature (The Bear) sideways to attack.
   * Rule: You do not need to pay mana (Lands) to attack. It’s free!

**Blocking (The Math)**
 * If Dad blocks with a Goblin (1/1):
   * Your Power (2) vs His Health (1): You hit him for 2. Goblin dies.
   * His Power (1) vs Your Health (2): He hits you for 1. Bear is hurt (down to 1 health), but survives.
   * Important: Bear heals back to full health at the end of the turn!
 * If Dad blocks with his own Bear (2/2):
   * You deal 2 to him (He dies).
   * He deals 2 to you (You die).
   * TRADE: Both cards go to the graveyard.

Card
Top Right: 
* number in a grey circle means 2 of any color - you can tap 2 mountains or 2 forests to use it
* Two red circles (fire/sun) you must tap 2 specific red land cards (mountains for these).  
* Total math: you need 4 land cards: 2 mountains + 2 other lands

Bottom right: 4/3
* 4 = sword (attack power)
* 3 = defense

5 main colors / elements
* white = yellow sun
* Blue = water (wizard)
* Black = graveyard
* Red = fire 
* Green = forest creatures

Dad = 20
