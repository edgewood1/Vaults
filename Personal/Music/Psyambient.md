     **ery important part of our life- on the work, at home, on the parties and afterhours belongs to low bpm music- that is lately named as psychedelic downtempo.
This, quite huge music sector is still new, but the rise and popularity gain of it is obvious. As an in every upcoming movement, there is still a lick of the information about the artists, labels and communities of Downtempo World.
 As well no one can clearly identify the terms and division of the subgenres of that music.

For this reason from now and on, we have decided to put more attention to that content and we start with publishing a maximum detailed report:**

     ## 
**PSYCHEDELIC DOWN-TEMPO**


 </span> <span style="text-align: center;">
     **In general, we can put in Psychedelic Downtempo folder any type of electronic  music occurs psychedelic  effects and sound hallucination which is  slower than psychedelic or psy-progressive trance. The tempo, as well as the drum patterns of each track can vary. Sometimes the beat can be restrained and/or simple. Sometimes the beats are more complicated and more featured instead of being in the background, but even then they are less intense and more hypnotic, than trance. As you will find out from this report, downtempo encompasses a wider variety of styles than usual terms, related to usual Chill Out music.

Ambient is often described as having an atmospheric, enveloping, unobtrusive, background sound. The style originated in the 1970s from the music of Brian Eno (in USSR originated by Mikhail Chekalin). It has developed into several forms from then on. Ambient music conquered popularity in the early 1990s, thanks to such bands as The Orb, Aphex Twin and Future Sound of London.

However, ambient is still a rather vague notion. Representatives of some different genres can be also defined by this term, for example: “academic” experimental electronic music (Chris Meloche, David Shea, Asmus Tietchens, David Toop, Oval), space music (Robert Rich, Steve Roach, Vidna Obmana, Klaus Schulze, Jeff Greinke, Alio Die), dub (Bill Laswell, The Orb, Mick Harris, Drome, Woob), ethno electronica (Jon Hassell, Banco de Gaia, Astralasia), industrial (Lustmord, Merzbow , Final, Aube, James Plotkin), club culture hybrids (The KLF, Global Communication, Mixmaster Morris, Biosphere, Higher Intelligence Agency, Sun Electric, Tetsu Inoue, David Moufang, LTJ Bukem, Autechre).

In 2002 record producer Jeff Towne and journalist Peter Manzi (New Age Voice Magazine) ranked the top ambient albums of all time. Among the experts invited for selection there were the following musicians: Steve Roach, Robert Rich, Stephen Hill (founder of Hearts of Space record label), etc.

As a result "The 25 Most Influential Ambient Albums of All Time" were selected. The Top 25 included both the classical works (Brian Eno and Steve Roach) and the albums usually classified as progressive rock (Tangerine Dream), as well as electronic music (Kunst Grand, Jean Ven Robert Hal, Aphex Twin, The Orb) and even jazz (Miles Davis). This way the very "ambient" definition expanded essentially.
Many musicians and bands of different psychedelic electronic music genres have been playing on alternative and chill out dance floors of all the trance music festivals            of the world and participating in lots of club projects for years.
Mixing of "acid" synthesized sounds with beat base and classical ambient music has recently resulted in a new style called psychedelic ambient or “psybient”.

Psybient has all the reasons to be called "The New Age" of music, the future of psychedelic sound on dance floors. It is a slow (deep hypnotic sounding at 105-120 bpm) variety of psytrance. Synths or live samples with typical "floaty" sound and ambient elements are often based on slow rhythm (that can be different from beat).

They get filtered and repeatedly edited with additional effects meant for achieving the most psychedelic sound.

The harmonious melodic sound wave is easy to pick up. It is based on the strongly expressed beats that make one move with the same smoothness due to its tempo.

Psybient can equally include electronic sounds and traditional instruments, archaic vocal techniques and elements of meditative singing. Sometimes electronic sound can be combined with ethnic and modern musical instruments, space sounds of synth keyboard and music overtones.

There is as well a slower variety of psybient used for meditations and ritual practices.**

     ## **PSYCHILL**


 </span> <span style="text-align: center;">
     **Сhill out is an umbrella term for several styles of electronic music characterized by their mellow style and mid-tempo beats — "chill" being derived from a slang injunction to "relax. Psychill is hard to define, as there are many different kinds of it, but it can be described as electronic music that combines elements of psychedelic trance, ambient, world music and new age into a spacy psychedelic chill out genre with the tempo above 104 bpm and lower…  Often  a fat groovy deep melodies has many ambient/psybient influences.

 Chill out music emerged in the early and mid-1990s in "chill rooms" at dance clubs, where relaxing music was played to allow dancers a chance to "chill out" from the more emphatic and fast-tempo music played on the main dance floor.

Although similar to psytrance’s emphasis on maintaining non-stop rhythm throughout the night, psychill is far more focused on creating a vast soundscape that can be experienced over the length of an album, focusing less on beat matching and allowing for a myriad of tempo changes.**

     ## ***Psychedelic chill out culture appeared probably in trance festivals.***
 </span>

 <span style="text-align: center;">
      **The idea is to chill and rest from dancing, to listen to tunes and to speak about life. Psychill is mostly electronic music, often more complex than chill out, ambient and lounge. It might or might not have a defined rhythm section. Often psychedelic chill out music contains samples from eastern and other traditional instruments, and sound FX and samples from psychedelic gurus like Timothy Leary or Terrence McKenna.      
Psychill originated, like psytrance, in the smallest state of  India, Goa. Because of the heat, humidity, and dust in Goa, the birthplace of Goa trance, DJs tended to use cassette tapes or DATs instead of vinyl records. As a result, beat matching was very hard. As a solution to the dilemma, a production technique developed of having relatively long atmospheric portions in each track, which would allow a DJ to easily mix two tracks of different tempos without having them clash. These short periods that were free of heavy, bass driven beats acted as “chillout” periods for those who were dancing (or tripping) to relax and regain their energy for the next track. These atmospheric interludes in the Goa trance parties were the roots of the psybient/psychill
genre.

The founders of Psy Chill music we can name The Infinity Project (Raga Ram and Graham Wood) with the debit album   "Mystical Experience"  (released on Blue Room records 1995 )**
