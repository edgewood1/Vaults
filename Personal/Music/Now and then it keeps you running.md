# Now and then it keeps you running

Now and then it keeps you running
It never seems to die
The trail's spent with fear
Not enough living on the outside

Never seem to get far enough
Staying in between the lines
Hold on to what you can
Waiting for the end, not knowing when

May the wind take your troubles away
May the wind take your troubles away
Both feet on the floor, two hands on the wheel
May the wind take your troubles away

Tryin' to make it far enough
To the next time zone
Few and far between past the midnight hour
You never feel alone, you're really not alone

Switching it over to AM
Searching for a truer sound
Can't recall the call letters
Steel guitar and settle down

Catching an all-night station
Somewhere in Louisiana
It sounds like 1963
But for now it sounds like heaven

May the wind take your troubles away
May the wind take your troubles away
Both feet on the floor, two hands on the wheel
May the wind take your troubles away

May the wind take your troubles away
May the wind take your troubles away

Walking down Main Street, getting to know the concrete
Looking for a purpose from a neon sign
I would meet you anywhere the western sun meets the air
We'll hit the road, never looking behind

Can you deny, there's nothing greater
Nothing more than the traveling hands of time?
Sainte Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear stained eye

Seeing traces of the scars that came before
Hitting the pavement still asking for more
When the hours don't move along
Worn-out wood and familiar songs
To hear your voice is not enough
It's more than a shame

Can you deny, there's nothing greater
Nothing more than the traveling hands of time?
Sainte Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear stained eye

Like the man said, rode hard and put away wet
Throw away the bad news and put it to rest
If learning is living and the truth is a state of mind
You'll find it's better at the end of the line

Can you deny, there's nothing greater
Nothing more than the traveling hands of time?
Sainte Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear stained eye

Sainte Genevieve can hold back the water
But saints don't bother with a tear stained eye

When you find what matters is what you feel
It arrives and it disappears
Driving down sunny 44 highway
There's a beach there known for cancer
Waiting to happen

When you're out across the county line
The news travels slower than a ten-second buzz
But only you'll ever know
'Cause day by day it disappears
Only you'll ever know

And it's hard enough soaking up billboard signs
You scorch and drown alive, never knowing why
The levee gates are open wide
There's a cough in the water and it's running into town

Bright eyes, don't change, stay the same
There must be an answer for what keeps it going on
But only you'll ever know
'Cause day by day it disappears
Only you'll ever know, only you'll ever know
'Cause day by day it disappears
Only you'll ever know

Sky cracks open, walls falling to the floor
Just as well to keep it a guessing game in store
You're with me now, will be again
All other points in between

And the cruel, cruel mornings
Have turned to days of swim or sink
If living right is easy, what goes wrong

You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown
Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
Silence knows, can't drown a heart

Happenstance is falling through the cracks each day
Too close now to change it, fool's gold is lighter anyway
When in doubt, move on, no need to sort it out
You're with me now, will be again
All other points in between

And I want to find the right side of you
If living right is easy, what goes wrong

You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown
Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
Silence knows, can't drown a heart

When in doubt, move on, no need to sort it out
You're with me now, will be again
All other points in between

And I want to find the right side of you
If living right is easy, what goes wrong

You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown
Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
Silence knows, can't drown a heart

You may be quite sure you know where you're going
But sooner or later you're out of the picture
Too many lost names, too many rules to the game
Better find a focus or you're out of the picture

Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still

Firemen save a millionaire's mansion
But when it's done, they sleep on the side of the road
You may be lost, you'll find just another paradigm
Just a stop frame in time, then you're out of the picture

Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still

Take away this Columbus Day
No more bones on display
Blackhawk never had a say
Just taken out of the picture

Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still
Somewhere along the way the clock runs out
Somewhere along the way it all stands still


Can't find a reason
Can't find a way
Guess it's not you and me
Only dogs have their day

Another case of words that melt
It's not a question of right
Nightmares in broad daylight

Season crash, season burn
You survive another turn
And now I'm reaching out, it's true

When you don't see me
I'm catching on to you
You don't see me
I'm catching on to you

Took a break to get that far
Like the sound from a hundred-dollar guitar
Bought from an old catalogue
Yesterday's dust and heartache

As the pieces fall
Like candy when you're young
Medicine when you're old

There's no reason or rhyme
Sidestepping around
On an elevator climb

When you don't see me
I'm catching on to you

Another jail, another burned-out inside
Skeleton love left to die
Take whatever lies ahead
The good with the bad and leave the rest

When you don't see me
I'm catching on to you
You don't see me
I'm catching on to you

Catching on
Catching on
