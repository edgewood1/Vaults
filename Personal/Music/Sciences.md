Hey David, the quote looks good. A few notes: 
* **Motion-detection:** Let's add the extra $200 for the ideal location.  I will go to Home Depot to look at some lights.  We might be selecting a less traditional light for this purpose - not so much a flood light but more like something in the link below
* **Lamp Movement:** We may have to add an extra charge for the other two lamps if they have to be moved 1-2 feet horizontally.  My wife will likely have more specifics when you get here. 
* **Connections:** Finally, could you use <u>**[Wago 221 lever nuts](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462744624808118,imageDocid:3774700151274198119,gpcid:14591656896926558325,headlineOfferDocid:14260938708265323427,catalogid:16741942930177068333,productDocid:13009995826814295573,rds:PC_14591656896926558325%7CPROD_PC_14591656896926558325&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjey_C04cmRAxUmrokEHV__LX0Qxa4PegYIAQgEEAQ)**</u> for the final sconce connections so that we can more easily swap the sconces ourselves in the future.

also, can you *I’d like you to use* <u>***[Wago 221 Lever Nuts](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462744624808118,imageDocid:3774700151274198119,gpcid:14591656896926558325,headlineOfferDocid:14260938708265323427,catalogid:16741942930177068333,productDocid:13009995826814295573,rds:PC_14591656896926558325%7CPROD_PC_14591656896926558325&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlg5Gu28mRAxXASDABHXiZJX4Qxa4PegYIAQgIEAI&biw=1024&bih=724&dpr=2)***</u> *for the final connections in the junction box. I want to be able to easily lift the levers to swap the sconces myself if I change styles in the future."*

* We maybe have to move the other two wall lamps 1-2 feet horizontally away from the plug, so that might add.  Also, we would like it set up so that we can easily change wall lamps later.  

When speaking with your electrician, use the following language to get exactly what you want:
* **The Specific Request:** "I would like to convert this plug-in sconce to a hardwired installation, but I want to use **lever-style quick connectors** (like <u>**[Wago 221s](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462689364404976,imageDocid:4202634200262708970,gpcid:14531309019496422417,headlineOfferDocid:5169400880874040549,catalogid:4943842926363971734,productDocid:16182556199704313915,rds:PC_14531309019496422417%7CPROD_PC_14531309019496422417&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4hfa92smRAxUJg4kEHYmAIxMQxa4PegYIAQgFEAI)**</u>) or a **plug-and-play disconnect** inside the junction box."
* **The Reason (Why):** "I want a **'quick-disconnect' setup** so the fixture can be easily removed for painting or maintenance without having to un-twist wire nuts." 

## **Recommended Interfaces**
While a **TP24 connector** (the orange/white 2-pin plug) is technically a connector, it is primarily intended for recessed lighting and may not be the standard choice for a wall sconce. Instead, electricians typically use: 
1. **Lever Connectors (Wagos):** These are the modern industry standard for "plug-and-play" hardwiring. They allow you to "clip" the wires in and out instantly, providing a much cleaner and more reliable connection than old-fashioned wire nuts.
3. **Molex or Quick-Connect Pigtails:** If you specifically want a male/female plug, the electrician can install a small **universal quick-disconnect pigtail** inside the wall box. 

## **Important Technical Considerations**
* **Grounding:** Most plug-in sconces lack a ground wire. Your electrician will need to ensure the metal housing of the sconce is properly grounded to the wall’s electrical box during the conversion to meet safety codes.
* **Code Compliance:** Under the **National Electrical Code (NEC)**, cords are not allowed to be used as a replacement for permanent wiring. The electrician will likely replace the external cord with internal "fixture wire" that stays hidden behind the mounting plate
