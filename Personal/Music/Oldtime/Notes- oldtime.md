# Lost Indian

Ed Haley’s Lost Indian is in A.  Sounds a bit different than Kenny Baker / Kessingers in D, which is the more familiar. They’re on YouTube.  To stir it up, the Cherokee shuffle sounds like the Baker tune but with the an extra part and in A. 

Clark Kessinger plays the familiar version of Lost Indian in D.  Ed Haley has a very different version in A, and as Taylor mentioned, the Cherokee Shuffle sounds like the D version of Lost Indian but in the key of A and a short C section thrown in.  Hmmmm. ;-)
