**1. Minimalist / I-Chord Dominant (Your "All 1")**
* **Description:** Many old tunes, particularly modal ones (like Dorian, Mixolydian, or sometimes Aeolian) or very old tunes, heavily emphasize the tonic (I) chord. Sometimes, the entire tune or section might be harmonized *only* with the I chord, with the harmony being implied by the melody notes against a drone or simple rhythmic backing.
* **Characteristics:** Often feels drone-like or hypnotic. The melody carries all the harmonic interest.
* **Example Feel (Key of G):** The entire A part might just be backed by a G chord.

**2. I - V Based (Your "Contains only 1-5")**
* **Description:** Progressions using only the tonic (I) and the dominant (V) chords. This is very common. The V chord creates tension that resolves back to the I.
* **Characteristics:** Creates a fundamental sense of tension and release. Found in countless fiddle tunes.
* **Common 8-Bar Patterns (Examples):**| I | I | I | V | I | I | V | I | (V appears near end of phrases)
	* | I | V | I | I | I | V | I | I |
	* | I | I | V | V | I | I | V | I |

**3. I - IV Based (Your "Contain only 1-4")**
* **Description:** Progressions using only the tonic (I) and the subdominant (IV) chords. While less common as the *only* chords than I-V, the I-IV movement is a staple sound.
* **Characteristics:** Has a gentler, less driving feel than the I-V relationship. Often associated with "plaintive" or "bluesy" sounds (though the blues structure itself is different).
* **Common 8-Bar Patterns (Examples):**| I | I | IV | IV | I | I | I | I |
	* | I | IV | I | I | I | IV | I | I |

**4. The "Standard" I - IV - V (Incorporating your "1-4-1-5")**
* **Description:** This is arguably the most common structure in major key old-time tunes. It uses all three primary chords: tonic (I), subdominant (IV), and dominant (V). Your "1-4-1-5" sequence is a *part* of many such progressions.
* **Characteristics:** Provides a full, balanced harmonic foundation with clear points of tension (V) and relaxation (I), plus movement away from the tonic (IV).
* **Common 8-Bar Patterns (Examples):**| I | I | IV | I | I | V | I | I | (Common A Part)
	* | I | IV | I | V | I | IV | I - V | I | (More movement)
	* | I | I | I | I | IV | IV | I | V | (IV often emphasized in B part start)
	* | I | I | IV | IV | V | V | I | I |

**Missouri changes**

* **I I  I V**
* **I IV V I**


**5. Modal Progressions with a bVII Chord (Your "Contains a 7")**
* **Description:** This typically refers to tunes in Mixolydian or Dorian modes, which naturally have a flattened 7th scale degree. This leads to a *major* chord built on that flattened 7th (bVII), often used instead of, or alongside, the V chord.
* **Characteristics:** Creates a distinctively "old" or "modal" sound. The bVII doesn't resolve as strongly to the I as the V chord does.
* **Key Examples:**In G Mixolydian: Chords are G (I), C (IV), and F (bVII). Dm (v) might appear but F major is characteristic. | G | G | C | G | G | F | G | G |
	* In A Dorian: Chords are Am (i), D (IV), and G (bVII). Em (iv) is also common. | Am | Am | G | G | Am | D | G | Am |
* **Note:** Sometimes "contains a 7" might refer to a V7 (dominant 7th) chord, which adds the flattened 7th *to the V chord*. This is common but slightly less characteristic of the *oldest* layers of the tradition than the bVII. | G | G | C | G | G | D7 | G | G |
**6. Progressions with Minor Chords (Your "Contains a 6")**
* **Description:** This usually involves the relative minor (vi) chord. Less commonly, the supertonic minor (ii) or mediant minor (iii) might appear.
* **Characteristics:** Adds color and a touch of melancholy or different harmonic flavor. The vi chord is often used as a substitute for I or IV, or as a stepping stone.
* **Common 8-Bar Patterns (Examples in G Major):**(vi is Em) | G | G | C | G | Em | C | G | D |
	* (ii is Am) | G | Am | C | G | G | D | G | G | (Less common in core old-time)
* **Note:** In minor keys (Aeolian mode), the i, iv, and v (or V) chords are primary, along with the bVI and bVII often.

| Dominant 7th (V7)            | I, IV, V7                    | Stronger pull to I           | Contains a 7 (V7 - variant)  |

**Important Considerations:**
* **A vs. B Parts:** The A part and B part of a tune often have different harmonic patterns. The B part might be simpler (staying on I) or more complex (moving more to IV or V).
* **Melody is King:** The chords primarily follow and support the melody, not the other way around.
* **Rhythm Guitar Style:** Old-time backup guitar often uses simple bass note runs (e.g., walking between G and C) and straightforward strumming, emphasizing the beat rather than complex chord voicings.
* **Variations:** Players develop their own preferences, and harmony can evolve. Some modern old-time players incorporate more complex chords.
* **"Crooked" Tunes:** Chord changes follow the irregular phrases of the melody.
These categories cover the vast majority of harmonic structures you'll encounter in traditional Appalachian fiddle music. The beauty often lies in the subtle variations within these relatively simple frameworks.

Okay, I've organized the list you provided ("Oldtime tunes - Mark / Mike") into the chord pattern categories we discussed.
**Important Considerations:**
* **Source List Interpretation:** This categorization relies heavily on interpreting the notes provided in your list (like "1415", "OOXo", key indications) and cross-referencing with common knowledge of these tunes. Some notes were ambiguous ("6th 4th All-I" without context, "?").
* **Variability is High:** As stressed before, chord choices are not fixed. A tune listed as "Standard I-IV-V" might be played simpler (I-V) or with modal chords (bVII) by different players or in different regions. Notes like "sometimes 4 is 6" highlight this perfectly.
* **Crooked Tunes:** Tunes explicitly marked as crooked ("x", "XOO") or known to be crooked are grouped separately, as their structure dictates the harmony more than a standard pattern.
* **Duplicates:** Some tunes appeared multiple times in your list (e.g., Sally Ann, Lost Girl). I've included them based on their context in the list, but categorized them based on their most common structure.
* **Irish Tunes:** Tunes noted as Irish often fit standard patterns but might have slightly different harmonic tendencies sometimes.
