# if you find yourself standing

if you find yourself standing
at the end of your line
looking for a piece of something
maybe a piece of mind
fed up, lost, and run down
nowhere to hold on
tired of, take your place at the end son
we'll get to you one by one

no light ever shines
dead end tears that dry
maybe a waste of words and time
never a waste of life
every hour will be spent
filling a quota, just getting alonghandcuffs hurt worse
when you've done nothing wrong

no thanks to the treadmill
no thanks to the grindstone
there's plenty of dissent from
these rungs below
the clockwork of destruction
hanging low over our heads
always a smokestack cloud
or a slow-walking death

no light ever shines
dead-end tears that dry
maybe a waste of words and time
never a waste of life

no thanks to the treadmill
no thanks to the grindstone
there's plenty of dissent from
these rungs below
the clockwork of destruction
hanging low over our heads
always a smokestack cloud
or a slow-walking death

no light ever shines
dead-end tears that dry
maybe a waste of words and time
never a waste of life
maybe a waste of words and time
never a waste of life 

come, all you coalminers
wherever you may be
and listen to the story
that I relate to thee
my name is nothing extra
but the truth to you I tell
I am a coalminer
and I'm sure I wish you well

I was born in old Kentucky
in a coal camp, born and bred
I know about old beans
bulldog gravy and cornbread
I know how the miners work and slave
in the coalmines every day
for a dollar in the company store
for that is all they pay

mining is the most dangerous work
in our land today
plenty of dirty, slaving work
for very little pay
coalminers, won't you wake up
and open your eyes and see
what this dirty capitalist system
has done to you and me

dear miners, they will slave you
until you can't work no more
and what will you get for your laborbut a dollar in the company store
a tumbledown shack to live in
snow and rain pouring through the topand you have to pay the company rentand your payments will never stop

they take our very lifeblood
they take our children's lives
take fathers away from children
take husbands away from wivescoalminers, won't you organize
wherever you may be
and make this a land of freedom
for workers, like you and me

I am a coalminer
and I'm sure I wish you well
let's sink this capitalist system
to the darkest pits of hell 

we've got two kinds here
those that bleed the blood
and those that work to will it
can't believe the big screen
there's no justice in the hall
we're all criminals waiting to be called

we've got shackles to keep the laws
made by men who bought and sold themselveswith not a prayer to keep their powers at bay
they want us kinder and gentler at their feet

they say don't step off the sidewalk
and don't cross over the line
but we'll serve time at night
when the light begins to dim
when the smoke seems to clear
you can say what you want
we're all criminals here

how many times will the teeth bite the tonguelooking for salvage in the damage that's done
I searched for you every place I thought I knewstill we're criminals looking for something to do 

in memory of a miner
who dragged himself to work
and worked himself to deathworking for someone else
we follow each other around on shaky ground

his life had become to him
worthless in many ways
an expired product off the shelf
working for someone else
we follow each other around on shaky ground

the nature of his work
gave him a minstrel color
twenty hours a day
little time he had for others
we follow each other around on shaky ground

never got to see the world
he got a funeral and this miner's song
there is no right or wrong

now it's down to the wire
facing six feet under
can only wonder and stare
his name was a number

I've been a moonshiner
for seventeen long years
and I spent all my money
on whiskey and beer
and I go to some hollow
and set up my still
if whiskey don't kill me
Lord, I don't know what will

and I go to some barroom
to drink with my friends
where the women they can't follow
to see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
with breath as sweet as
the dew on the vine

let me eat when I'm hungry
let me drink when I'm dry
two dollars when I'm hard up
religion when I die
the whole world is a bottle
and life is but a dram
when the bottle gets empty
Lord, it sure ain't worth a damn 

A worn out joke to keep the flies away
Carried it this far
Got the west side winds to keep it steady
We bury the hatchets we find
Could carry that heavy load
If I really thought it would matter
Farcical hair appears
As a blind side, clean the slate
Working in the halls of shame
Lay it down in full view
Lay it down
What the hell were we thinking
Before the fire burned out?
I can't find you now
And I didn't know you then
Loneliness drinks the bitters
Till the cold winds warm again
It's a feel for the game
Mouth open wide, screams and hollers
Working in the halls of shame
Lay it down in full view
Lay it down
I gambled once and won, never made a dollar
And beauty fades to grey
And I pray the very best will guard her
And provide the way
It's a telltale sign
When it's chairs up, and time to go
Working in the halls of shame
Lay it down in full view
Lay it down 

I've been searching and you've been gone
Out looking for the shortest path to the one that you're on
And I've already seen all I wanna see
Come on, let's take the long cut
I think that's what we need
When we were younger, we were strong
We felt a lot better than the things that we'd done
Now if it's to be, if you still believe
Come on let's take the long cut
I think that's what we need
If you wanna take the long cut
We'll get there eventually
I've been searching and you've been gone
Out looking for the shortest path to the one you're on
Now if it's to be, if you still believe
Come on let's take the long cut
I think that's what we need
We've been in a deep rut
And it's been killing me
If you wanna take the long cut
We'll get there eventually 

You threw out the past
When you threw out what was mine
Throughout the years
It was hard to make it last
Anodyne
No sign of reconciliation
It's a quarter past the end
Full moon from on high
Across the board we lose again
Anodyne
Anodyne
Tossed it out for me to find
Without a word you're out the door
Without a reason anymore
Two fingers on the trigger
Can break the heart of any day
Foolish to believe
It would turn out okay
Anodyne
Anodyne
Tossed it out for me to find
Without a word you're out the door
Without a reason anymore
Anodyne 

Watch it separate in two
Whatever the day wants it to
Finding out that the worst is true
Finding out that it can escape you
Slings and arrows completes the score
Always leaving, wanting more
And I try to throw it away
Silver spikes and mace
Displayed in your eyes
Fearlessness, cannot fathom;
What's on your mind?
Been there, no luck at all
Nothing left to lose
Been there, no luck at all
Nothing left to lose
I've been there
"Danger/Slow" says the sign ahead
Exhaust fumes, Thin Lizzy instead
Left all pressing cares along the road
Fifteen keys, but where do they go?
Slings and arrows completes the score
Always leaving, wanting more
And I try to throw it away
Strings that pull, strings that bend
This song and dance never ends
