# Buzz and grind

Buzz and grind

E	
Fool around with my hearth 
D A
Fooling around … fooling around 
X1

One day you will find
It’s going to take patience x2
For a different story

E
Driving around like sunshine
A
No questions no complications
E
All is pure with no bills to pay
A	
Its happening right here and now
D A
These good times
E
At the buzz and grind

Capitol Hill with a corporate face
Its going take patience, action
To make the story different

Corporate town watch your tone
Its’ going to take action going to take patience
To make a difference

Fraughting around like sunshine…
