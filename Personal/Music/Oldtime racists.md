# Oldtime racists


I recently read an article that suggested when people discard songs with a racist history, they ignore the history behind them.   **Instead they suggest we** first really digging into the history of the song and understanding why it's racist. This includes learning about the harm it caused.  Importantly, it also means **involving students** in this learning process. Together, you decide if the song should be completely removed or kept *only* for learning about its history, but not for singing or playing in the usual way. It's like carefully taking apart something harmful to understand why it was bad. The article even compares this to taking down Confederate monuments – you're recognizing a harmful past and deciding what to do with it.

Just **replacing** the words with nicer ones can also be a problem. Even if the words are different, the tune and rhythm might still remind people of the original racist meaning. It's like trying to cover up something bad without really fixing it.

**Radically replacing** means creating entirely *new* music that promotes fairness and stands against racism. This isn't just changing the words; it's about thinking big and imagining a better, more just world. Students could write poems about equality and then create music for them, or even make new arrangements of songs that already have positive messages, like "We Shall Overcome". The idea is to use your imagination to build something new and positive instead of just patching up something old and hurtful.


* **Who needs to be extra thoughtful?** The article specifically talks about **white teachers** needing to be extra mindful in this process. They need to **decenter whiteness**, which means not assuming their own experiences are the only or most important ones. Instead, they should **center the experiences of Black, Brown, Indigenous, and Asian/Pacific Islander (BBIA) communities**. This involves really listening to and understanding the perspectives of people from these communities. It's important for white teachers to avoid unintentionally taking over or making decisions *for* BBIA students without understanding their experiences.
So, the solution isn't a quick fix of just deleting or rewording. It's a more involved process of learning, discussing with students, and then actively creating new, positive musical experiences that stand against the history of racism in some folk songs.

Are they suggesting we take a racist song, and instead of just replacing the lyrics with nicer ones, we
