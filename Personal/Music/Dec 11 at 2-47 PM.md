Hi neighbors,

We’re Monica and Moe Rivera, the applicants for the rezoning at 105 W Knox (the Wright House/Whitehall), and we wanted to briefly introduce ourselves and share a little context.

We live on E Trinity in Old North Durham with our two kids. Monica is an herbalist and yoga teacher (Cultivating Resistance Herbals), and Moe is a massage therapist (Massage by Moe). Together we created Bulltánica as a neighborhood‑based wellness project, which has been operating at the UDI building at Old Five Points since 2020.

Our connection to Whitehall is through its longtime owner, our neighbor and friend, Graham Marlette. Graham has entrusted Moe with day‑to‑day stewardship of the house and grounds as we work together to chart a future for the property. His late brother, Wade Marlette, spent decades opening Whitehall to arts and community life, and we see this next chapter as a way to continue that legacy of cultural and community use rather than lose the house altogether.

Right now we have a home‑occupation permit that allows us to offer the same kind of small, by‑appointment wellness services we’ve always done, while we begin caring for the land and planning repairs. The house needs significant work and is under real financial pressure. The goal of the rezoning is to make it possible to close on a historic rehabilitation loan so that Whitehall can be properly restored and preserved instead of slipping further into disrepair.

Our long‑term vision is for the Wright House to remain visually the same from the outside and to serve as a quiet, community‑oriented space for wellness, herbal education, and small gatherings that fit the residential feel of Duke Park and Old North Durham.

We’ll be hosting some open‑house times and conversations at the Wright House so folks can see the space, ask questions, or share concerns in person. In the meantime, you’re very welcome to reach out:
	•	Monica: monica@bulltanica.com
	•	Moe: moe@bulltanica.com

All neighbors with questions or concerns about the rezoning process are invited to the Neighborhood Meeting on Monday 12/22 from 5:30-6:30pm at 105 W Knox St. 

Thank you for all the care so many of you already put into this neighborhood. We hope the Wright House can be part of that story going forward.

With care,
Monica & Moe Rivera
Bulltánica / Cultivating Resistance Herbals

This is interesting, because it looks like the space is already being used in this way and they are looking for support to renovate the house. I'd be curious if immediate neighbors have noticed anything different.

Hi Neighbors,
 
I saw this sign outside of the Wright House across from the Duke Park entrance at on Knox St.  I hadn't seen any posts about it so I thought I should share it with neighbors.  There's a neighborhood meeting to discuss the rezoning of this property to OI (Office and Institutional) scheduled for Dec 22 at 5:30 pm.  I'm not expressing opinions one way or another in this post, simply passing on information. 
 
Per the UDO, an Office is defined as a room, group of rooms, or building whose primary use is the conduct of a business, professional service, or governmental activity of a non-retail nature; including administration, record keeping, clerical work, and similar functions. This definition is not meant to include manufacturing, processing, repair, or storage of materials or products.

I couldn't agree more, Susannah. What a great vision for this space- to be used collaterally by two neighborhoods, to serve multiple purposes. I, too, must miss the meeting, but I'd be so interested to participate and to hear more. 

Moe, Monica, and Graham- does the situation demand a quick turnaround? 
The more participation, the more support you can garner, no?

My interpretation of Moe and Monica’s vision is that the Whitehall Terrace mansion / pool / cottage will become their personal family home and that a portion of the mansion will house their for-profit businesses. Moe is currently offering $180 massages in the mansion and the cottage. 

Their GoFundMe page requests urgent funds to build a ramp, an additional bathroom for guests, and a rooftop terrace with a shade structure, lighting, and seating. (The GoFundMe pages lists the “beneficiary” of the funds as Monica’s non-profit arm of her business.) 

Their vision also includes a bed-and-breakfast. 

The request for rezoning of Whitehall Terrace will allow a door to begin to open for these for-profit businesses. Was this Wade’s vision? 

Note: So far, the city is not requiring a traffic study or a certificate of appropriateness (to ensure the renovations align with historic preservation) for the project. The city has been told that there will be no additions to the property, just historic preservation and stability.

> Jennifer, 
I read your frustrated comments. They seem to be based on some inaccuracies. I’d like to talk with you to answer any questions you have and to hear your concerns. I’d also love to hear from you about your relationship with Wade, and any stories you want to share about him. 

To everyone, 
Here a few important details about our request. 
— We are not proposing a bnb or airbnb short term rental
— The rooftop is not an addition. The rooftop terrace is actively leaking, and there is extreme water damage that needs to be repaired as swiftly as possible. After our financing is secured, we will pursue a COA for an awning to prevent future damage. 
—We currently have a home occupation permit, and are legally permitted to conduct our business at 105 W Knox. The rezoning change request is not to allow business operations; it is to secure the funding we need to pay off the debts owed on the property and complete the rest of the needed repairs. 
—Massage by Moe, now Bulltánica, has been operating out of the UDI center in Old Five Points for five years. His clients include physicians, professors, and athletes. He also offers sliding scale pricing and discounts to clients who attend community events. Moe is working to move his office to the cottage behind the mansion, and we hope to add additional practitioners as we expand our spaces. The Sauna House (and several other Durham-based practices) offers a shorter massage session for the same price. 

On Graham Marlette’s behalf, we have been stewarding this house and Wade’s estate process since he died in February. It has been wonderful to connect with his friends and neighbors that knew him well. We are still planning a public celebration of life for Wade in 2026, and we hope to connect with neighbors that have cherished memories of him still to share. 

Sincerely,
Monica Rivera

Thanks for this. 
I was confused when people started to talk about Whitehall as a meeting place for DP and a bit of a community center 🤷‍♀️

I did not read any of that in Monica’s initial post. 

I’ll be in interested to continue to hear the plan evolve. 

Whitehall is a special place (& Monica & Moe sound like special people), but the fantasy of a community center sounded weird to me.  

I spent many Fourth of July potlucks with Wade, neighbors & friends,  as well as Wade’s fabulous holiday parties over the 20+ years I lived on Little Mangum.

Neighbors,

I am genuinely open to dialogue including questions and differing opinions about our rezoning application. However, spreading factual inaccuracies about who we are or what we are proposing is hurtful and potentially harmful. The goal of this early phase of the rezoning process is to understand whether neighbors have concerns and, where possible, to identify solutions that allow the process to move forward in a way that is considerate of the surrounding community. We welcome dialogue that moves in this direction. 

To clarify one point specifically: part of our longer-term vision includes making the upstairs loft of the cottage behind the main house available for occasional overnight stays for out-of-town clients. That structure is **not** included in the rezoning application.
The language you referenced from our website emerged from informal visioning conversations held in early spring, during which several friends and neighbors of Wade’s shared that they had long imagined Whitehall functioning as a small B&B. The language was intended to explore possibilities, not to outline a finalized business plan.

These are the kinds of topics we hope to discuss at the neighborhood meeting on Monday. If you’re unable to attend, you’re welcome to email me directly so we can continue the conversation. We will host an additional Neighborhood Meeting after the first planning review (approximately 6-12 weeks), and we are hosting a series of listening conversations about the community education garden we’re building and future programming at Whitehall. Check our website for details if you’re interested. 

I appreciate engagement when it’s grounded in good faith and accuracy, and I hope we can continue from that place.
Best,
Monica Rivera

Thanks for this. 
I was confused when people started to talk about Whitehall as a meeting place for DP and a bit of a community center 🤷‍♀️

I did not read any of that in Monica’s initial post. 

I’ll be in interested to continue to hear the plan evolve. 

Whitehall is a special place (& Monica & Moe sound like special people), but the fantasy of a community center sounded weird to me.  

I spent many Fourth of July potlucks with Wade, neighbors & friends,  as well as Wade’s fabulous holiday parties over the 20+ years I lived on Little Mangum.

My interpretation of Moe and Monica’s vision is that the Whitehall Terrace mansion / pool / cottage will become their personal family home and that a portion of the mansion will house their for-profit businesses. Moe is currently offering $180 massages in the mansion and the cottage. 

Their GoFundMe page requests urgent funds to build a ramp, an additional bathroom for guests, and a rooftop terrace with a shade structure, lighting, and seating. (The GoFundMe pages lists the “beneficiary” of the funds as Monica’s non-profit arm of her business.) 

Their vision also includes a bed-and-breakfast. 

The request for rezoning of Whitehall Terrace will allow a door to begin to open for these for-profit businesses. Was this Wade’s vision? 

Note: So far, the city is not requiring a traffic study or a certificate of appropriateness (to ensure the renovations align with historic preservation) for the project. The city has been told that there will be no additions to the property, just historic preservation and stability.

I wanted to chime in and share that over several years of interaction with Moe and Monica in OND, my experiences with their leadership have been entirely in keeping with the community-centric vision they outlined. 

Monica and Moe have been advocates for and community leaders in Old North Durham, just around the corner.  Monica in particular has done a lot of community building and liaisoning on our behalf, particularly around safety and interactions with the city (traffic on Trinity, spraying for West Nile). 

I encourage people with concerns to engage with Moe and Monica directly, but if anyone is worried about developer double-speak (vs. something like logistical considerations that Helena noted above), I can add one voice speaking to experiences of sincerity.

I must also miss the first meeting, but my two cents is that I am in favor of the vision. I've interacted with Moe and Monica in/at 105 W Knox multiple times now and I'm excited to see what will blossom from their hard work with neighbor support.
