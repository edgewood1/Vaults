You are absolutely right. I over-pruned that file in the final step. I turned your detailed "How-To" guide into a "Cheat Sheet," which defeated the purpose of having an **Ops Manual**.

Below is the **Full, Unabridged Version of File 7**. It restores every step, command, and checklist item from your original notes (restoring the 100+ lines of detail), plus the glossary addition we discussed.

Please save this as the actual file.

# Woodrose Ops Manual: EC2 Migration & Hosting

Use this guide to understand how to provision a server, secure it, and point a domain name to it.

## 1. Architecture Decision: Amplify vs. EC2
* **Amplify:** Great for rapid prototyping and static sites. It manages the server for you.
* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** A "blank canvas" virtual server. It requires more work (installing updates, configuring firewalls) but offers total control and mimics an enterprise production environment.
* **Current Status:** Migrating `wildwoodrose.org` from Amplify (CloudFront) to a custom EC2 instance.

## 2. Server Provisioning (The "Hardware")
**Step A: Launch the Instance**
1. **OS:** Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu.
2. **Instance Type:** `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible).
3. **Network:** Must be in the **Same VPC** as your RDS Database (to ensure connectivity).
4. **Key Pair:** Download the `.pem` file (e.g., `woodrose.pem`). This is your "physical key" to the server.

**Step B: Accessing the Server (SSH)**
You access the server via terminal using the key file.
* **General Syntax:**
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
    ```
* **Woodrose Specific Command:**
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/woodrose.pem ec2-user@ec2-44-204-83-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

## 3. Server Configuration (The "Software")
Once logged in, you must manually install the runtime environment. Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Update the OS
sudo yum update -y

# 2. Install Node.js and Git
sudo yum install nodejs git -y

# 3. Clone the App
git clone <your-repo-url>

# 4. Install Project Dependencies
npm install -g yarn
yarn install

```

## 4. Security Groups (The Firewall) 🛡️

AWS has a firewall outside your server called a **Security Group**. You must explicitly open ports for traffic to flow.

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Source Restriction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **22** | SSH | Admin Access | **Your IP Only** (Best Practice) |
| **3000** | TCP | Node App (Dev) | `0.0.0.0/0` (Public) or Your IP |
| **80** | HTTP | Web Traffic | `0.0.0.0/0` (Public - Required for Certbot) |
| **443** | HTTPS | Secure Web | `0.0.0.0/0` (Public) |

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** If you cannot see your site, 99% of the time it is because you forgot to add an Inbound Rule for Port 80 or 3000 in the Security Group attached to the instance.

## 5. Production-Readying (Nginx & SSL)

Running an app on Port 3000 is for development. In production, you use a Reverse Proxy (Nginx) to handle traffic on standard Web Ports (80/443).

**Step A: Configure Nginx**
*Concept:* User hits Port 80 → Nginx receives it → Nginx forwards it internally to your App on Port 3000.
*File Location:* `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name wildwoodrose.org;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Forwards to your Node app
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

```

**Step B: Enable HTTPS (Certbot)**
Certbot automatically talks to "Let's Encrypt" to get a free SSL certificate.

* **Command:** `sudo certbot --nginx`
* **Requirement:** Port 80 must be open to `0.0.0.0/0` so Let's Encrypt can verify you own the server.

## 6. Going Live: DNS Switching (Route 53)

The final step is telling the internet that `wildwoodrose.org` now lives at your EC2 IP, not the old Amplify address.

**Detailed Procedure: Updating Route 53 A Records**

1. **Open Route 53:** Go to the AWS Console → Route 53 → **Hosted Zones**.
2. **Select Zone:** Click on your domain name (e.g., `wildwoodrose.org`).
3. **Locate Record:** Find the row where **Type** is **A**.
4. **Edit Record:**
* Select the record and click **Edit Record**.
* **Value:** Delete the old value (e.g., CloudFront URL) and enter your **EC2 Public IP** (`44.204.83.90`).
* **TTL (Time To Live):** Lower this to `60` seconds during migration to make changes propagate faster.


5. **Save:** Click **Save changes**.
6. **Verify:** Wait 1-5 minutes, then check your domain in a private browser window.

## 7. Woodrose "Next Steps" Checklist

* [x] **UI Framework:** Added Mantine UI.
* [x] **Styling:** Added Tailwind CSS.
* [ ] **Refactor:** Fix TypeScript types.
* [ ] **Architecture:** Clean up file structure.
* [ ] **Logic:** Fix "Hints" logic (currently always shows "irregular").

## 8. Project Command Glossary 📖

* **`npx prisma db push`**: Syncs your local schema file with the actual database.
* **`docker-compose up -d`**: Starts your local database container in the background.
* **`yarn build`**: Compiles the React app for production.
