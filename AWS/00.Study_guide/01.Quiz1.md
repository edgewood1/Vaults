### **Which Files to Study First?**

If you only have limited time, study these two first. They provide the highest return on investment:

1. **`01_Core_Infrastructure.md` (File 1):** This is the vocabulary. You cannot have a conversation about AWS without knowing what a "VPC," "Subnet," or "IAM Role" is.
2. **`03_Environment_Mapping.md` (File 3):** This is the "Rosetta Stone." It connects these abstract cloud terms to the things you already know (Localhost, Docker, `.env` files). It will make the concepts stick.

### **Study Guide: Q&A Series**

Here is a flashcard-style Q&A set for those two critical files.

#### **Set A: Core Infrastructure (File 1)**

*Focus: Networking, Security, and Compute.*

**Q1: What is the difference between a Public and a Private Subnet?**

* **Answer:** A Public Subnet has a route to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)**, allowing direct access to/from the internet. A Private Subnet does not; it uses a **NAT Gateway** to send outbound traffic but blocks all incoming connections.
* **The "Why":** You put web servers in Public (so users can reach them) and Databases in Private (so hackers can't).

**Q2: I need to debug my Lambda function. It failed, but I don't have a terminal window. Where do I look?**

* **Answer:** **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**.
* **The "Why":** In AWS, you don't SSH into Lambda. All `console.log` output is sent to CloudWatch. The Lambda needs the `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` permission to do this.

**Q3: Explain "Security Groups" to me like I'm a bouncer at a club.**

* **Answer:** A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for a specific resource (like an EC2 instance). It checks every packet's "ID" (IP address) and "Purpose" (Port).
* **The "Why":** By default, it blocks everything. You must explicitly "add a name to the list" (e.g., Allow Port 80 for Web Traffic) to let anyone in.

**Q4: When would you choose EC2 over Lambda?**

* **Answer:** Choose **EC2** if you need full control over the OS, long-running processes (like a WebSocket server), or consistent performance. Choose **Lambda** for bursty traffic, event-driven tasks (like processing a file upload), or to save money on idle time.
* **The "Why":** EC2 is a "pet" (you feed and care for it). Lambda is "cattle" (AWS manages the herd).

**Q5: What is the difference between an IAM User and an IAM Role?**

* **Answer:** A **User** is a person (has a permanent password/key). A **Role** is a "hat" or "badge" that a user or service puts on temporarily to gain permissions.
* **The "Why":** You don't hardcode passwords into a Lambda function. You assign it a **Role** so it has permission to access the Database only while it's running.

---

#### **Set B: Environment Mapping (File 3)**

*Focus: Translating "Local Dev" to "Cloud Prod."*

**Q6: On my laptop, I put my database password in a `.env.local` file. Where does that go in AWS?**

* **Answer:** **AWS Secrets Manager**.
* **The "Why":** You never commit secrets to Git. In AWS, the app retrieves the secret programmatically at runtime (or via environment variables injected from Secrets Manager).

**Q7: I run `npm start` to launch my app locally. What is the equivalent "Server" in AWS?**

* **Answer:** It depends. For the backend logic, it's **Lambda** (or EC2). For the frontend static files, it's **S3** (served via CloudFront).
* **The "Why":** In "Serverless," there is no single "Server" running `npm start` continuously. The code sits dormant until an event wakes it up.

**Q8: Locally, my React app talks to `localhost:3000`. What does it talk to in Production?**

* **Answer:** It talks to **API Gateway** (via a public URL like `api.wildwoodrose.org`).
* **The "Why":** API Gateway sits at the edge of your VPC, accepts the request, and routes it to the correct internal Lambda function.

**Q9: How do I run a "Cron Job" (Scheduled Task) in this serverless setup?**

* **Answer:** **Amazon EventBridge** (Scheduler).
* **The "Why":** Since you don't have a server running 24/7 to check the time, you set a rule in EventBridge to "poke" your Lambda function every day at 2:00 AM.

**Q10: My local database runs in a Docker container. What replaces that container in Prod?**

* **Answer:** **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service).
* **The "Why":** You *could* run Docker on EC2, but RDS manages backups, patching, and scaling for you, so you treat the DB as a service, not a container.
