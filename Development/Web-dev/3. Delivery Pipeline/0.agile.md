# A Comprehensive Guide to DevOps Concepts

This document provides a consolidated overview of DevOps topics, covering Agile methodologies like Scrum, tools such as Jira and Jenkins, and CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions.

## 1. Agile Project Management & Methodologies

### 1.1. Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework that helps teams work together to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products. It's designed for teams to learn from experience, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

### 1.2. Jira for Scrum

Jira is a popular tool for issue tracking and agile project management.

**Issue Hierarchy:**
-   **Epic**: A large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. An Epic often spans multiple sprints.
-   **Story**: A user story is a requirement or feature expressed from the end-user's perspective. The value of a story is realized when its parent Epic is complete. A standard format is: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."
-   **Sub-task**: A smaller piece of work required to complete a story.

**Jira Workflow Note**:
In some workflows, an issue (Defect, New Feature, or Improvement) must be linked to a test case (e.g., via an "is tested by" link) before it can be resolved. If this link is missing, you may need to move the issue back to a "Ready" status to trigger the automated creation of a test link.

### 1.3. User Stories and Acceptance Criteria (AC)

A user story describes the "who", "what", and "why" of a requirement. Acceptance Criteria (AC) are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other stakeholders. They are a set of statements, each with a clear pass/fail result.

**Tips for Writing Good AC:**
-   Each criterion should be testable.
-   Criteria should be clear and concise, not ambiguous.
-   Focus on "what," not "how." Describe the observable outcome from the user's perspective, not the implementation details.

### 1.4. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD extends Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing test cases in a natural, human-readable language. It focuses on the system's behavior from the user's point of view. This encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical participants.

**Gherkin: The Language of BDD**

Gherkin is a business-readable, domain-specific language for defining behaviors without detailing how that behavior is implemented. It's saved in `.feature` files and uses a specific structure with keywords.

-   **`Feature`**: A high-level description of the software feature.
-   **`Scenario`**: A concrete example of how the system should behave in a particular situation.
-   **`Given`**: Describes the initial context or pre-condition.
-   **`When`**: Describes an event or action performed by a user.
-   **`Then`**: Describes the expected outcome or result.
-   **`And`**, **`But`**: Can be used to chain multiple `Given`, `When`, or `Then` steps.
-   **`Background`**: Adds context to all scenarios in a feature. It runs before each scenario.
-   **`Scenario Outline`**: A template for running the same scenario with different data.

**Example Gherkin Scenario:**
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username and password
    And the user clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to their dashboard
```

-   **Cucumber** is a popular testing framework that understands Gherkin and can execute these scenarios as automated tests.
