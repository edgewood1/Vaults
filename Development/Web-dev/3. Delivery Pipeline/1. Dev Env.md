1. • Simulation: docker-compose (Spinning up local Postgres/Redis to mimic prod).
2. • Automation: Makefiles / Taskfiles (Shortcuts: make dev, make db-up).
3. • Standards: Linting/Prettier (configured to run on save/commit).




## 3. General Best Practices

### 3.1. Writing a Good `README.md`

A `README` file is the front door to your project. It should contain:
-   **Project Title**: A clear and concise name.
-   **Description**: A short explanation of what the project is, the motivation behind it, and what it does.
-   **Table of Contents**: For longer READMEs.
-   **Installation**: Step-by-step instructions on how to get the development environment running.
-   **Usage**: How to use the project. Code examples are very helpful.
-   **API Documentation**: A reference for the project's API, or a link to it.
-   **Screenshots/Demos**: Visual aids to show the project in action.
-   **Testing**: Instructions on how to run the project's tests.
-   **Contributing**: Guidelines for how others can contribute to the project.
-   **Credits**: Acknowledge collaborators, inspirations, and key libraries.
-   **License**: Information about the project's license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
-   **Badges**: Status badges for build, code coverage, version, etc., can provide a quick, scannable overview of the project's health.
