1. • Runner: GitHub Actions.
2. • Tasks: Install dependencies \rightarrow Lint \rightarrow Test (Unit/Integration).



## 2. CI/CD and Automation Tools

### 2.1. Introduction to Build Automation

Build automation is the process of scripting and automating the activities involved in creating a build artifact (the deployable software), including compiling source code, running tests, and packaging the application.

**Build Automation Servers** (or CI/CD servers) are tools that execute these automated builds on a scheduled or triggered basis.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of frequently merging all developers' code changes into a shared mainline. Each merge triggers an automated build and test run.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: The practice of automatically deploying every passed build to a testing or production environment.

Common tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, Bamboo, and GitHub Actions.

### 2.2. Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying.

**Practical Example: Using "Build with Parameters"**
Jenkins jobs can be parameterized to allow users to provide inputs at runtime. This is common for deploying specific branches to specific servers.
1.  Navigate to the Jenkins job (e.g., "Feature Build Deploy").
2.  Select "Build with Parameters."
3.  Fill in the required parameters:
    -   `branch`: The name of the feature branch to deploy (e.g., `CSA-5305-study-notes`).
    -   `build`: The component to build (`Web`, `RestApi`, or `All`).
    -   `server`: The target server to deploy to (e.g., `cs-feature`).
4.  Another common use is reverting a server to a clean snapshot before deployment using a "master deploy" job with a `revert` option.

### 2.3. GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline directly from GitHub.

**Core Concepts:**
-   **Workflow**: An automated process defined in a YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` directory.
-   **Trigger (Event)**: An event that starts a workflow, such as a `push`, a `pull_request`, a `schedule`, or a manual dispatch.
-   **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner.
-   **Runner**: A server that runs your workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS), or you can host your own.
-   **Step**: An individual task that can run commands or an action.
-   **Action**: A reusable unit of code that performs a specific task. Actions can be from the marketplace (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2`), a public repo, or your own custom action.

**Workflow Syntax Keywords:**
-   **`name`**: The name of your workflow.
-   **`on`**: Specifies the trigger event(s).
-   **`jobs`**: Defines one or more jobs to run.
-   **`runs-on`**: The type of machine to run the job on (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
-   **`uses`**: Tells a step to use a specific action.
-   **`run`**: Tells a step to execute a command-line program.
-   **`needs`**: Specifies that a job is dependent on another job and must wait for it to complete.
