Four archetypes

Lead
- scope complex tasks and coordinate their team towards solving them, and unblocking them along the way
- Define vision, build alignment on technical issues.
Architect
- responsible for specific technical domain that is complex and central 
- Balance business needs, user’s goals, and relevant technical constraints
- Needed in companies with extremely complex codebases & with needed technical debt
Solver
- dives into tough problems until resolved & leaves it to others to maintain the solved problem
- Occurs in teams that think as individuals rather than teams as the atomic unit of ownership
Right hand
- stay aligned with leaders approach, and they intersect business, tech, popele, culture, process. Work on essential problems and move from one to the next.
Overall
- 1 & 2 may work with the same people and problems for years
- The other two may jump from fire to fire. 
What do staff do?
- set and edit technical direction: ie, a technically-oriented product manager; they speak for the tech; tech advocate. They might lead API design but balance with business needs.
- Provide sponsorship / mentorship rather than personal heroics.  Read Lara Hogan’s What does sponsorship look like?
- Inject engineering context into organizational decisions, exploration, and be glue (say in pendo meetings)
- Do ambiguous exploratory work to solve system issues; have enough respect that others see a fail as a reflection fo the problem and not you. (Research stories)
- Keep the team moving forward and shipping its work (code review lane clear)
- You don’t pursue interesting work out of personal interest - you must put the business and team first and model good behavior. ***
- A big part of the learning curve is that much of the work you do has a slower feedback cycle. 
- If your advancing your career, you time available for work shrinks, and your expectations around your impact will keep growing.  
- Avoid  easy and low impact work when hard nand high-impact work is available.
- Teach your company to value something it doesn’t care about - this is hard. 
- Invest a few hours per week developing the team around you.  
- Do work that matters, do projects that develop you.

Question
