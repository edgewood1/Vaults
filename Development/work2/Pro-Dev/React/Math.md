# Math


Multiplication - adding one number to itself a certain number of times to give a single result, called the product.  With this operation, we have a number of items per group, and a number of groups to tally. It can be represented as a rectangular array: 3 rows of 3 items. It has several properties: 
* commutative: order of numbers does not affect result
* associative: the grouping doesn’t affect result
* distributive: when we multiply by a sum of 2+ numbers, we can distribute the multiplication over each addendum, and hen add the products.  a * (b+c) = a * b + a * c
* identity - when you add zero, it doesn’t change.  When you multiply by 1, it doesn’t change
* inverse: when you add the opposite, you get zero.  When you multiply by the reciprocal, you get 1.

If you have multiple numbers to multiply, you can multiply the smallest ones together first. 

Divisibility - the state where one number can be divided by another without leaving a remainder. 12 is divisible by 4 because we can divide 12 into 4 equal parts, each part being 3.  Numbers divisible by 2 are called even.  Numbers not divisible by 2 are odd.  There’s a list of 12 divisibiity rules on p15.

Factor - a whole number that divides the number evenly without leaving a remainder.  Factors of 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.  If we want to find the factors of 36, we begin with 1 and end at 18 (36/2), testing each one.  If you reach a middle number that is a factor with itself (6) than this is the square root.
