# Nikki Work issue


1. Started day to a series of negative comments regarding the app.  They seemed sporadic
2. Sense that my messages were not being read, considered, regarded. 
3. Assumption that she knew everything, and i did not.  As if attempting to defend her work. 
4. The sense that she doesn’t have the time to consider, that she’s in a rush, overwhelmed. 
5. In meeting disregard: Backing down during one:one. - different persona then in a meeting or slack. 
6. Generally, there’s a sense of drama that comes from impulsiveness and not slowing down.  A lack of thoughtful regard of work and others. The sense that I’m not really appreciated but during one-one I am. 
7. Drama.   If something’s due in 4 weeks we should get it done 2 weeks early that way the other side has time to test drive it.  Crossed out was postponed two weeks so she said I should take two weeks of to work on other things.  
8. She interacts differently in group then one one.  Group the drama and show comes into play.  That’s anxiety but get over it. 

Generally


Organization

1. Lack of transparency 
2. Promotional unevenness
3. Organizational mobility.  To move to a different team or app.  Or even outside of game to further growth and meet new challenges. 
4. Work with different personalities
