**Serialization** is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization

**Serialization** is the process of turning data (e.g. variables) into a representation such as a **string**, that can easily be written and read back from for example a file or the database
