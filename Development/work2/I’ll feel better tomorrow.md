# I’ll feel better tomorrow

I just need to rest. 
When i talk, it hurts my chest a lot. 
I was hot and dripping wet from the bath
The towel - i used it to wipe away the dripping water.bc 

Bc i need a lot of towels - at least 2.
After a bath

I need two 
One for my hair/head one for my body.

**I am bigger so have more body to dry
So i need two not one**

Ok, goodnight sweet dreams you are the best. 

Good night heart

I’m a good typer - one day you will be to after you finish thqt typing  course. 
Maybe next year no rush

I’m sorry.

I meant you had less skin / body surface to dry.

I didn’t accidentally say it, i just meant it in a different way than you understood it. 
Ok
BYE
We’re done.
