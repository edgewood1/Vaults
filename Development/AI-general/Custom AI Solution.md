[[Core Capabilities]] - represent the customization of _core AI capabilities_. They are like specialized "senses," "brains," or "tools."



[[Orchestration-Action]] - represent _how those core capabilities are put together and used_.




While you can list "Engine," "Wheels," "Transmission," and "Navigation System" as distinct custom components of a car, the "Self-Driving Capability" (like an agent) would _use_ the custom engine, wheels, transmission, and navigation system to achieve its goal.
