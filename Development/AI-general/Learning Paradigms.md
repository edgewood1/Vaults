These are “categories of ML problems”..  They describe teh style of learning process based on teh type of data used.  And the goal. 


* [[Supervised learning]]- uses labeled data
* [[Unsupervised learning]] - uses unlabeled data


- [[Reinforcement Learning]] 
- [[Semi-Supervised Learning]]

1. **Supervised Learning:** Learning from **labeled data** (inputs have known correct outputs). Goal: Predict outputs for new inputs.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Learning from **unlabeled data**. Goal: Find hidden patterns or structures (like grouping similar items).   
    
3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Learning through **trial and error** by receiving rewards or penalties for actions in an environment. Goal: Learn the best sequence of actions (policy).   
    
4. **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Learning from a **mix** of labeled and unlabeled data.   
    

**Think of the **Paradigms** (Supervised, Unsupervised, RL) as different _types of classes_ in a school:

- Supervised = A math class where you get problems with correct answers to learn from.   
    
- Unsupervised = An art class where you explore materials to find interesting patterns without a single "right" answer.
- Reinforcement = A gym class where you learn to shoot baskets by trying, sometimes missing (penalty), sometimes scoring (reward).
