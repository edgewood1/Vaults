# 🎓 AWS Learning Roadmap & Study Guide

**Goal:** Move from "Outsider" to "Conversant Engineer" capable of passing a System Design interview and building cloud apps.

## 🟢 Track 1: The "Interview Prep" (Conceptual Mode)
*Use this track when you are away from the computer or reviewing for a conversation.*

**Step 1: Master the Vocabulary**
* **Source:** `01.Knowledge_base/1.core_infrastructure.md`
* **Drill:** Create flashcards for these 4 definitions. You must be able to explain them simply:
    1.  **VPC vs. Subnet:** (House vs. Room).
    2.  **NAT Gateway:** (The "One-way valve" for private internet access).
    3.  **Security Group:** (The "Bouncer" firewall).
    4.  **IAM Role:** (The "ID Badge" permissions).

**Step 2: Connect the Dots (The Bridge)**
* **Source:** `01.Knowledge_base/3.env_mapping.md`
* **Drill:** Cover the "Production" column with your hand. Look at "Local Dev" and try to guess the AWS equivalent.
    * *Prompt:* "I use `.env` files locally..." -> *Answer:* "Secrets Manager."
    * *Prompt:* "I use `localhost:3000`..." -> *Answer:* "Route 53 & Load Balancer."

## 🔵 Track 2: The "System Designer" (Architecture Mode)
*Use this track to understand how pieces fit together.*

**Step 1: Trace the Data Flow**
* **Source:** `02.Projects/1.Architecture_map.md`
* **Drill:** "The Finger Trace." Open the Mermaid diagram. Use your finger to trace a request from the **User** to the **Database**.
    * *Narrate out loud:* "User hits Amplify -> API Gateway -> Triggers Lambda (Private Subnet) -> Writes to RDS -> Updates Firebase via NAT Gateway."

**Step 2: Whiteboard Challenge**
* **Action:** Take a blank sheet of paper. Close all files.
* **Task:** Draw your app's architecture from memory.
    * *Check:* Did you put the Lambda inside the Private Subnet? Did you draw the NAT Gateway?

## 🟠 Track 3: The "Builder" (Hands-On Mode)
*Use this track when you are writing code or deploying.*

**Step 1: The "AI Handover"**
* **Context:** You are about to code a new feature.
* **Action:** Copy everything in `02.Projects/2.Handover_protocol.md`. Paste it into ChatGPT/Claude.
* **Prompt:** "Here is the context. I need to build the `ai-categorizer` function..."

**Step 2: The "Ops" Reference**
* **Context:** You messed up the server or need to deploy again.
* **Source:** `02.Projects/4.Ops Manual.md`
* **Action:** Follow the steps blindly. Do not memorize commands (like `certbot`); just know where to find them.
