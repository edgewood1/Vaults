# Godfather obligations


This is a significant honor.

Your role will likely be a hybrid of a traditional Spiritual Sponsor and a Trusted Elder/Mentor.

Responsiblities 

1. The Theological Dimension

Since the parents are "interpret it yourself" believers, it is unlikely they are asking you to ensure the child memorizes the Baltimore Catechism. However, they chose you—a Catholic—specifically. This suggests they value the stability, tradition, and structure you represent, even if they don't subscribe to it all themselves.

 * Be a witness to Tradition: In a "read it yourself" household, theology can sometimes become fluid. Your responsibility is to represent the 2,000-year history of the faith. You don't need to convert them, but you can be the person who answers questions like, "How have Christians historically understood this?"

 * The "Quaker" Bridge: Since the father has a Quaker background, he likely values inner light and conscience. As a Catholic, you can connect on the level of prayer. Your duty is to pray for the child daily—<u>**this is the one non-negotiable duty of a godfather in any denomination.**</u>

 * Ecumenical Respect: Support their desire to raise the child knowing Christ, focusing on what you share (The Gospels, the Nicene Creed basics) rather than where you diverge (Papal authority, specific sacraments).

2. Responsibilities to the Child

The biggest challenge here is the "30 miles and different friend groups" factor. A godfather cannot be a stranger.

 * The "Calendar" Uncle: You don't need to hang out casually, but you must show up for milestones. Your responsibility is consistency. If you are there for the baptism/dedication, birthdays, and perhaps one specific holiday each year, you build a "long-term" presence.

 * Moral Formation: As the boy grows, he will eventually clash with his parents or question their specific interpretation of the Bible. A godfather serves as a "safe," distinct adult who shares the family's core values but offers a different perspective. You are the release valve that keeps him within the faith ecosystem when he rebels against his parents.

 * Intellectual Resource: Given your age (55) versus the parents (30/25), you have life experience they lack. As the child grows, you become a source of wisdom that is distinct from his parents' generation.

3. Responsibilities to the Parents

At 25 and 30, they are relatively young parents. They likely view you as a figure of stability.
 * Non-Judgmental Support: Young parents often feel scrutinized. Your job is to encourage them. If they are overwhelmed, you are the steady hand who says, "You are doing a good job; this phase passes."
 * Bridge the Social Gap: Since you run in different circles, the onus is on you to initiate the occasional "check-in." They will likely be too busy with a newborn to reach out to you. A simple text once a month or a casual lunch invitation once a quarter signals, "I take this role seriously."

4. Practical Action Items
To bridge the 30-mile gap and the "friend group" disconnect, you need a system:
 * The Annual Tradition: Establish one thing you do with him every year. Maybe it’s a specific book you give him on his birthday, or a savings bond, or a handwritten letter to be opened when he turns 18.
 * The Spiritual Gift: Since the mother is sympathetic to Catholicism, simple, tangible symbols of faith (which Catholics do well) are appropriate gifts. A St. Francis medal or a high-quality illustrated Bible are things that last longer than toys.

Summary
You do not need to become their best friend. You simply need to be a consistent, praying presence. They are asking you to be a spiritual anchor. In a "do it yourself" faith household, you are the rock of history and tradition.

Because the baptism is at a Presbyterian church, the situation is actually much simpler for you than if it were a Catholic ceremony.
In the Presbyterian tradition, the role is often called a "Sponsor" rather than a "Godfather." This shift in terminology changes your responsibilities in a way that makes it easier for you to accept without compromising your own Catholic faith.
1. The "Official" Rules (Catholic vs. Presbyterian)
You should know how both churches view your role so you don't feel like an imposter.
 * The Presbyterian View: They recognize your Catholic baptism. To them, a sponsor is simply a mature Christian who stands with the parents to support them. They do not require you to be Presbyterian.
 * The Catholic View: Technically, the Catholic Church views your role in a non-Catholic baptism as a "Christian Witness." You are witnessing the validity of the baptism and promising to help the child grow in Christ. You are not promising to raise the child specifically as a Presbyterian, which protects your own conscience.
2. What Will Happen at the Ceremony?
Presbyterian baptisms are often less formal regarding the godparents than Catholic ones. You won't be asked to recite the Nicene Creed or denounce Satan in Latin.
You will likely be asked to answer "I do" to questions such as:
 * "Do you promise, through prayer and example, to support and encourage [Child's Name] to be a faithful Christian?"
 * "Do you promise to nurture this child in the faith and help him grow in the knowledge and love of God?"
The Good News: These are "Mere Christianity" promises. As a Catholic, you can make these promises in good conscience because they center on Christ, prayer, and scripture, not on specific Presbyterian doctrines (like predestination).
3. Your Specific Responsibilities in this Context
Since the parents are "interpret it yourself" believers and the church is Presbyterian, your role as a Catholic "Elder" is even more valuable.
 * Be the "Anchor" of Tradition: "Interpret it yourself" Christianity can sometimes feel unmoored. As the boy grows, he might ask, "What do we actually believe?" You can be the one who gently points him to the things all Christians share—the Apostles' Creed and the Gospels—giving him a foundation that goes beyond just his parents' personal interpretations.
 * The "Ecumenical" Bridge: You don't need to try to make him Catholic. Instead, focus on the habits that both Catholics and Presbyterians value: Charity and Scripture.
   * Action: When he is old enough (7 or 8), buy him a high-quality youth Bible. It honors his parents' focus on the Bible but allows you to guide him toward serious engagement with it.
 * Support the Parents' Choice: Even though you are Catholic, validate their choice to baptize him. In a world where many young parents skip baptism entirely, affirm them: "I'm really proud you guys are doing this. It's important."
4. Navigating the Distance (30 miles away)
Since you won't see them weekly at Mass, you need a "Presbyterian-friendly" way to stay connected spiritually:
 * The Name Day (or Baptism Day): Catholics celebrate "Name Days" (the feast of the saint they are named after). Presbyterians generally don't. You can introduce this fun tradition. Find out the saint associated with his name, and send him a card or small gift on that day every year. It’s a low-pressure way to bring your Catholic "flavor" to his life without overstepping.
Summary
Your responsibility is not to ensure he becomes a Presbyterian. Your responsibility is to witness that he has been baptized into Christ and to be a steady, prayerful Christian man in his life.
Immediate Next Step:
Send a text to the father: "I'm honored to stand with you guys. Just so I'm prepared, could you ask the pastor if there are specific vows or questions I'll need to answer during the service? I want to make sure I’m ready."

1. **Born under St. Athanasius (May 2):** The Defender of the Faith.
2. **Baptized under St. Ambrose (Dec 7):** The Teacher of the Faith.
You have a "Bookend" of two of the greatest Doctors of the Church guarding this kid.
**Next Step for Tomorrow:**
If there is a reception or a quiet moment after the baptism, you can mention this to the parents: "I looked up the dates—he was born on the feast of St. Athanasius and baptized on the feast of St. Ambrose. Those are two of the smartest men in Christian history. He’s got a good team watching over him."
It’s a great compliment to their son that doesn't feel "preachy." Good luck tomorrow!
