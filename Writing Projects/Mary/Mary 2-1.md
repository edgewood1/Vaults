Hey Mary!

I’ve been playing with this software that allows you to link concepts together in cool ways.   This “knowledge bank” is the start of looking into the Thiel-cohort’s move into government, and speculation into where it will all go.   
Unsurprisingly, there’s a connection to Nick Land.  He’s got a book called Xenosystems, and in the first article references this other article which defines a “left singularity”: <u>[https://archive.ph/wqfsq](https://archive.ph/wqfsq)</u>

I’ve attached a summary quote below.  

Anyhow, maybe we could create a “knowledge bank” around our own random conversations and discover that they are not so random after all!  

I started listening to the Hermatrix interview about Steiner’s POF ~ I’ve read the first half of that book so many times, and struggled to find a decent translation.  Aaron’s explanation for all the prefaces were illuminating!  

Summary of “left singularity”:

The concept of a "left political singularity" describes a recurring pattern in certain left-wing political movements characterized by a self-reinforcing cycle of escalating repression, where each phase becomes more extreme than the last. It’s speculated that the public shaming of cancel culture and the ideological purity tests that provide increasingly narrow and rigid definitions of social justices would be contemporary examples.  

The articles goes on to give historical examples that include the French Red Terror, the Soviet Great Terror, and the Cambodian autogenocide. 

Obviously, these examples feature mass deaths that are absent from contemporary ones, but it implies that the underlying dynamics of ideological purity, self-reinforcing radicalization, and the silencing of dissent are present in both historical and contemporary contexts. Both also feature the drive to enforce conformity, the fear of being labeled "impure," and the escalation of demands.
It suggests that the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is that left-wing repression tends to politicize all aspects of life, forcing conformity to a constantly shifting and increasingly radical "correct" ideology. This creates a dynamic where individuals and leaders compete to be "more left" than others, leading to purges of those deemed insufficiently radical. A key survival strategy in these regimes is the principle of "no enemies to the left," meaning that individuals must constantly demonstrate their ideological purity and avoid any association with those perceived as less radical.
Supposedly, this process stands in stark contrast to right-wing repression, which tends to depoliticize society. Regimes like Pinochet's encourage apathy and withdrawal from political life, whereas left-wing repression intensifies political engagement and ideological fervor. 
The underlying theory posits that leftism, in this context, functions as a kind of "theocracy" that expands unchecked when it encounters weak resistance. It is driven by a constant pursuit of ideological purity, unlike right-wing movements, which are seen as more diverse and reactive. The constant shifting of what is considered acceptable within leftism creates a system where people are constantly trying to outdo one another, leading to a spiraling escalation of radicalism and repression.
However, it’s probably clear to most that both left-wing and right-wing movements can be intensely political and have the potential for extremism and violence. While some right-wing movements may advocate for reduced state intervention in certain areas, like economic regulation, they often promote strong state action in others. 

The question of who defines and enforces morality—the state or the community—is central to this article.  State-driven tendencies manifest as laws dictating acceptable behavior and speech, indoctrination to promote this ideology, and surveillance and punishment of those who deviate. It ignores the positives.  Community-driven morality allows for norms to emerge organically from social interactions and cultural traditions, which can foster greater social cohesion.  It ignores the negatives.
