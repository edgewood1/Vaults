Hey! 

Nice bio summary.  I’m not so familiar with Gurdieff and Ouspensky, but after some wild imagining, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were embroiled in espionage. 

They were both well-travelled, multi-lingual, and had connections, charisma, and followers, traits that intelligence agencies likely look for in recruits.

In exchange for funding and influence, intelligence would have likely used the group for further recruitment and covert operations, as they were already organized, secretive, and well-versed in hidden agendas, information control, and undisclosed and exclusive memberships. 

Considering the agency’s interest in mind control and unorthodox intelligence-gathering techniques, such as remote viewing, ESP, and ET communication, the agency likely gained access into and insights from the experiments conducted by the followers.

As you mentioned, Gurdieff and Ouspensky were operating at the tail end of the 100 year rivalry between Russia and Britain, so it wouldn’t be surprising if they were double agents or at least independent agents who sold their insights and services to the highest bidder? 

Speaking of intelligence and the occult, I’m sort of curious about the process church, and how they’ve been linked not just with intelligence, but with Manson, Son of Sam, the JFK murders, and sex rings.   I’ll probably have to piece that together, but  what drew my attention are two recent documentaries: The Octopus Murders & Descent into Darkness.  The Octopus Murders highlights the Inslaw/Promise software scandal, which connects to a pretty wide and familiar range of suspects.  Descent into Darkness claims that Son of Sam acted with a group that were likely supplying snuff films for a larger organization that I would guess mediated between the Process church and Intelligence.
