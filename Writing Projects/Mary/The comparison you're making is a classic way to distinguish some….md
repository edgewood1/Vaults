The comparison you're making is a classic way to distinguish some key differences in Protestant and Catholic theology, particularly regarding sanctification and the role of works in salvation.
Protestantism: "Saved and Then Operate from a Saved Space"
In many Protestant traditions (especially those influenced by the Reformation), salvation is understood as a singular, past event that occurs through faith alone (sola fide).
 * Justification: A person is justified (declared righteous by God) the moment they put their faith in Christ. This is seen as a forensic, or legal, declaration.
 * Sanctification: This is the ongoing process of becoming more holy and Christ-like after justification. Your good works are not what save you; they are the fruit and evidence of your salvation. The person operates from a position of being saved, not for the purpose of being saved.
Catholicism: "Salvation as an Ongoing Journey"
In Catholic theology, salvation is a lifelong process that involves both faith and works, and it is not considered fully complete until a person's death.
 * Justification: While justification is a gift from God's grace, it is not a one-time event but a process that can be strengthened through the sacraments and cooperation with grace.
 * Sanctification: This is inseparable from justification. Good works are seen as a necessary part of the sanctification process. They are not merely the result of salvation but a way of cooperating with God's grace to grow in holiness. A person's salvation is viewed as an ongoing journey toward union with God, which can be lost through mortal sin.
The simplified contrast you've made is a useful way to highlight this theological difference. It captures the core idea that for many Protestants, salvation is a secured state from which you live, while for Catholics, it's a dynamic journey that requires constant cooperation and perseverance.

 * Justification is a theological term for God's act of declaring a sinner righteous. In a legal sense, it's a verdict of "not guilty" that frees a person from the condemnation of sin.
 * Grace is God's unmerited favor toward humanity. It's a free gift that a person cannot earn. Grace is the supernatural power that makes justification, salvation, and sanctification possible.
 * Salvation is the deliverance from sin and its consequences. It is the comprehensive term for being made right with God, which includes justification and sanctification.
 * Sanctification is the lifelong process of becoming holy. It is the ongoing work of God in a person's life that transforms them to be more like Christ. This process follows justification and is enabled by grace.

Yes, that's a very clear and accurate way to use those terms in a sentence, reflecting a Protestant understanding of the concepts.
"I am justified when I commit my life to God, and this justification means receiving God’s grace, which is a kind of salvation, and from then on, my life is marked by sanctification."
This sentence effectively outlines the sequence of events in many Protestant denominations:
 * Commitment to God leads to...
 * Justification (being declared righteous), which is made possible by...
 * Grace (God's unmerited favor). This entire process is a form of...
 * Salvation, which then begins the lifelong journey of...
 * Sanctification (becoming holy).

In a Catholic understanding, the sentence would be written to reflect that justification is an ongoing process of cooperation with God's grace, not a one-time event. The phrasing emphasizes that salvation is a journey that requires continued effort, not just a past commitment.
Catholic Understanding
"I am on a journey of salvation when I commit my life to God, and this commitment opens me to receive His grace, which begins the process of justification and is then nurtured by sanctification."
This version highlights that:
 * Salvation is a journey, not just a state.
 * Grace is what allows a person to begin and continue this journey.
 * Justification is a process that is initiated and nurtured by grace and sanctification.
 * The word commitment is used instead of a phrase like "commit my life to God" to emphasize the continual, ongoing nature of faith.
Key Difference
The key difference lies in the timing and nature of justification. The Protestant understanding views justification as a forensic, one-time act that secures salvation, with sanctification following as a result. The Catholic understanding sees justification as an ongoing, infused process that works with sanctification. For Catholics, justification is not guaranteed; it can be lost through mortal sin, making it a continuous journey of faith and good works, all enabled by God's grace.
