# Trans


From what I understand, Xenofeminists embrace technologies like genetic engineering, prosthetics, and hormone therapies as tools for individuals to transcend gender constraints.  While this primarily points transgenderism, transgenderism that uses technology to transcend gender could be seen as a form of transhumanism.   

Then, there’s the reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization, surrogacy, and artificial wombs that further give women (and one day men) more options and freedoms, if they were to choose to help bring a child into the world.   

Then there are the virtual and digital spaces that enable people to create digital identities, and online communities that challenge traditional notions of gender expression and identity.  

Lastly, there’s the notion of “genderless” AI and robotics (programmed without gender bias) that encourage non-traditional forms of communication.   

Over a decade ago, I first heard of transhumanism via the Anthroposophical folks, who were largely anti-tech, and they mostly frown upon the way tech creeps into the domain of the human, and chips away at the boundary between human and machine.  For them, this chipping away is driven by ahrimanic forces that actively seek to enslave humanity.   This has gnostic connotations

Not far from them, christian fundamentalists see the human and biological gender as natural categories, and since nature as it is is a creation of the creator, then overturning these categories has blasphemous connotations.  

I suppose, however, this view depends on how one define’s nature - does nature mean god-created, or both human & god-created?  Is nature a co-creation? 

Some might question the traditional binary between machine and human, but in creating hybrid forms, this binary can just be reproduced ( modified vs unmodified humans).   It’s a common sci-fi trope that modified humans hunt down the unmodified.

I’d say we’re all already transhuman due to our daily use of the internet, and the way that has radically altered consciousness.    And even if a person were to avoid the internet, they’d have to contend with a world that was fully immersed, and so in that sense, they’re still infected.   Then there’s the genetically modified foods that are widespread, the new generation of vaccines that hack our RNA and program it to reproduce new forms of objects, and the endless manufactured chemicals that are daily pumped into the earth and our bodies…
