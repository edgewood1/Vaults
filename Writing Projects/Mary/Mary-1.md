1. Natural order refers to the way things are born, grow, decline, die, the way they are organized and connect to one another. 
2. Trees fall in a storm, a person dies of a disease associated with old age or genetic mutation, hurricanes churn ocean and level a coastal plain.  
3. Things grow more complicated when people’s decision making get’s involved. 

Part of the natural order. 
1. A person cuts down a tree to build a house for their family.  

Shadowy: Is the difference between these two that 1. Replants or that 2. Is disconnected from the positive deed of building.

1. A community cuts down a slew of trees to build a neighborhood, but replants new trees.
2. An industry cuts down a forest, doesn’t replant, sells woods to others who themselves build homes, stores, ships, etc.

Moral evil: benefits (the negative outweighs the positive)
1. An industry hides fact that hey regularly dump toxic waste into a forest without intention of ever cleaning up.  The industry creates these toxins as a side-effect of building decorative widgets to be sold at fairs.
