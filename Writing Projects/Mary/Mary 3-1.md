I am not sure it is correct trace parentage for the form of magical practice Moore describes to 'Chaos Magic'--you are using the term 'Subjective Magic' which isn't in my tool box. Is there a chain of descent familiar to you? I do see why you might say that is what Moore practices, but I am not sure he would agree. Certainly in interviews he is dismissive of Chaos magic's demand for material proofs and power. And he never uses the term 'subjective magic.' But, again, placing what he is talking about in a boolean Hermeticism/chaos magic area does make sense. I wonder if he might prefer to think of it as a 3rd way, rather than an offspring of an uneasy marriage between traditional elitist magical traditions and the chaos modality that throws learned ritual aside. Lots more to say but I have a client at 10 am...

Subjective magic is just a term coined to describe a form of magic that prioritizes internal experience and the power of consciousness.  It’s not an official school of magic, but probably a useful term to distinguish it from objective or ceremonial magic, which uses external tools like incense, symbolism, and incantation to conjure intelligences into tangible form.

But there are probably better ways of categorizing.  I’m thinking maybe a threefold distinction between sacred magic (centered on cultivating agapic love, eg, orthodox prayer), formal magic (centered on forms and can be objective  or subjective and serve the ego or not), and black magic, which only serves the lower ego.

In a Nietzschean sense, all these paths could be considered elitism as they prioritize an "aristocracy of the spirit" - the noble values over popular culture and conditioned behavior.  

I’d say Moore practices a kind of formal magic, specifically a subjective and highly personalized form of chaos magic.  What defines chaos magic is likely not its pursuit of wealth and power, but rather its status as a self-styled hybrid form that doesn’t follow an inherited tradition. 

When Moore derides magic that pursues wealth and power, I guess he’s trying to distance himself from the popular notion of black magic.  However, his work has bought him great wealth and power, which creates a tension.   

His works are an example of imposing his vision on the world at mass scale.  He sees reality as a malleable construct that can be rewritten through creative acts.  By investing psychic energy and meaning into his creations, he believes he can make them real on a metaphysical level, influencing both his own life and the world around him.  

His stories are sometimes vehicles for the use of “hyper-sigils”, which is a complex long-form magical symbol.  

This approach is synonymous with chaos magic because it uses belief as a fluid tool and adapts various philosophies to serve his own creative and magical agendas.  He prioritizes his individual will over the divine, and his magic is pragmatic - he judges a magical ac by its results in the physical world.  He has claimed that as long as his work maintains its quality after applying his understanding of magic, he isn’t concerned if his understanding is "wrongheaded", and he has also stated that following "instructions from the gods" has led to beneficial results, regardless of whether these deities actually exist.  

As for that term “subjective magic”, I’d say it would have its roots in Hermeticism and Western Esotericism, with its idea that the universe is a living being and that human imagination can affect reality.  

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, figures like Austin Osman Spare and the early works of Aleister Crowley began to experiment with the idea that magic could be performed entirely within the mind, using focused will and sigils. This sort of “psychological” magic theorized that the subconscious mind was a powerful tool for manifesting change.

From this emerged Chaos Magic, in the 1970s, which formalized many of these ideas. It's often seen as the first school of magic to explicitly use belief as a tool—a deliberately chosen and discarded worldview to achieve a magical effect.

Grant Morrison as imposing his will rather than reflecting the divine will.
Here's a breakdown of that distinction:

Will and Choice
For Aquinas, the will is the power to choose, and the choice is the specific act of using that power. The will is the engine, and the choice is the vehicle's direction. Your point that a person will automatically choose what appears to be the better option is correct. The "appearance" of the good is a function of our intellect, which is flawed. The will then acts on that flawed judgment.

Grant Morrison's Approach

Tomberg's Perspective
Tomberg would view Morrison's approach as a form of the Magic of Knowledge or Form, or possibly even the Magic of Ego. Tomberg's central principle is that true magic is not about imposition but about reception and cooperation with the divine will. He would argue that Morrison, while powerful and creative, risks becoming a vehicle for a purely personal or even lower spiritual force rather than a channel for divine grace.
 * Tomberg's Ideal: Tomberg would say that the truly magical act is one that reflects the world as it is becoming by Divine Will, not as a person wants it to be. This means a surrender of the ego's desires and an opening to the subtle guidance of spiritual realities.
 * The Danger of Imposition: From Tomberg's view, imposing one's vision, no matter how good the intention, is a dangerous form of magical practice because it asserts the ego as the primary creative force. It risks creating a vision that is not aligned with the ultimate good, a kind of beautiful but ultimately soulless work.
In short, your analysis is precise. While both Grant Morrison and Valentin Tomberg are engaged in a form of magic, they are coming from opposite ends of the spectrum: one seeks to impose his will on reality, and the other seeks to conform his will to reality.
