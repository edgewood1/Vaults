I think the issue is that a lot of users are not informed as to the nature of it.  For example if I ask google search  “explain the difference between how Aristotle and aquinas understand form” it will find a website that contain what seems to be a possible fit for the answer but in my case seems to answer the wrong question Thomas Aquinas, much like Aristotle, wrote that nature is organized for good purposes. Unlike Aristotle, however, Aquinas went on to say that God created nature and rules the world by "divine reason." Aquinas described four kinds of law. Eternal law was God's perfect plan, not fully knowable to humans.

And then a bunch of other sites that may. Or May not also contain better answers


Chat gpt is not a query engine but a language generator that predicts probable answers based on an initial prompt so that if the prompt contains ambiguous words, phrasings or sentences that response will reflect this.   So the user has the phrase the prompt as if they were talking to a machine not a person.  Also the idea is that it’s a chat so there’s suppose to be a a chain of follow up questions to explore the topic in more detail.  I see it as a good resource for creative work.  When it clarifies a topic for me I use that as a springboard for crafting my own chain of reasonings. Also I can follow up by deferring to primary sources if necessary.  I see it as a personal assistant. I Can throw topics at it and see what sticks.  It’s not a substitute for human reasoning and creativity.  

ChatGPT and Google search serve different purposes and have different functionalities.

ChatGPT, like me, is an AI language model designed to have conversations with users and provide contextual responses based on the input received. It can engage in interactive dialogue, answer questions, provide explanations, and generate human-like responses. Its responses are based on its training on a wide range of text data and its ability to generate coherent and relevant language.

On the other hand, Google search is a search engine that indexes web pages and provides users with relevant search results based on their queries. It scours the internet for information and displays web pages, articles, images, videos, and other resources that match the search terms. Google search is excellent for finding specific information, looking up facts, researching topics, or browsing through a variety of sources.

In summary, ChatGPT is focused on generating conversational responses, while Google search is designed to retrieve information from the web.
