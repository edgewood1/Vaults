# Mary


* our ancestors make a series of choices that guide the hand of our parents in raising us and all the decisions they made around the class and culture we were born and raised through.
* Society reinforces these restrictions, being the accumulation of similar stories. 
* Society’s accumulated destruction upon the people and the earth as it in turn ravages us.
* The stars are determined that our lives unfold in a particular way.
