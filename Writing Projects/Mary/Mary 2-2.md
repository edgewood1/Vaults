I’ve been imagining subjective magic the literal set of physical and metaphysical actions whose effect is to help disrupt our inherited conditioning and change our relationship with the world and those higher powers that might further help us.  

As for this conditioning, I imagine them caused by ancestors, nature, and humanity, or if this were to be mapped, I’d guess that our circumstances are inscribed by fallen and redeemed aspects of  humanity and nature, "fallen" in the sense that they're marked by strains of disorder and trauma passed down through ancestral inheritance.  

This got me thinking about how subjective magic might be compared with positive thinking and contrasted with prayer.   

The practice of prayer, as described in texts like The Way of the Pilgrim, attempts to align one's will with God’s through repetitive petitions or mantras.  This is probably vaguely related to transcendental meditation. 

Subjective magic, with its roots in Hermeticism and Chaos Magick, applies the will and imagination to influence reality. The effects can range from artistic creation to spiritual awakening.

The positive thinking movement, documented by Mitch Horowitz, seems more of a secular approach focused on personal empowerment.  The stereotypical forms of prayer (asking god for a laundry list of things) probably fall into this category.

If orthodox prayer is related to surrendering one’s will for that of god’s, and magic & positive thinking is related to imposing one’s will (whether for good or ill), I’d guess most spiritual practices fall somewhere in between these?   A sensitivity practitioner is probably always trying to hone the right balance.
