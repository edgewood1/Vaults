1. Gaza suffering
2. Palestine-Israel a long issue, and many like it, unresolvable.
3. At the heart, bullies, like Netanyahu and Sinwar. 
4. Beyond them, Putin, Kim Yung Un, Iranian leader, Saudi leader. 
5. The bullies, the facists (Foucault).
6. Locally, the bullies on every playground, anti-social, and the way they seek to drain the love from others. 
7. The exist in everyone to degrees.
8. Tomberg describes these bullies as suffering the weight of cosmic numbness.
9. Numbness forces the world to be material and behave as it thus.
10. The key is to break out of familiar fixated perceptions, and to begin seeing things from all points of view.  
11. In breaking the hold of numbness within ourselves, we break it in the cosmos. 


The strategic adversary is fascism … the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us. It's too easy to be antifascist on the molar level, and not even see the fascist inside you, the fascist you yourself sustain and nourish and cherish with molecules both personal and collective. —Michael Foucault, Preface to the English edition, Anti-Oedipus : Capitalism and Schizophrenia by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari,

The inner mobility is none other than the power that  overcomes the numbness initially experienced at the third stage the meditation.  The numbness overcome in this way is the same force that in the cosmos brings about the numbness of the sense-perceptible starry world, and that also holds the mineral kingdom petrified on earth. When we are capable of moving through the circle of fundamental cosmic ideas, we overcome the numbing effect of the fixed star constellations and live with the spiritual revelation working through the zodiac. Two kinds of influence proceed from the zodiac: numbing influence from the fixed stars, and a revealing one from the beings of the zodiac. We have to overcome the one, but open ourselves discerningly to the other by learning to move through th whole circle of the zodiac. To do this, we must learn to observe th world not from one point of view only, but from twelve points view. Our 'I' must be capable of carrying out twelve different kinds of cognitive movement. If we have learned this, then the numbing power is overcome in our 'I'-consciousness, which then becomes a part of the world where the numbness controlling the starry world and the world of mineral nature is overcome. Here begins that process of overcoming, proceeding from the innermost part of the human being, that will ultimately call forth objective outer changes in nature, changes that will manifest during the future Jupiter existence. There will then no longer be a mineral kingdom in the sense of petrified and immobile substances.  
The power of the “I” to move from one outlook to another through the 12 signs of the zodiac was designated in antiquity as the power of “belief”, which was considered of a higher order than knowledge.  If the process of cognition consists in attain a certain outlook, then “belief” transcends this in being able to pass from that outlook to other outlooks.  It is the power of the “I” to be a “wanderer” through the circle of the mods of cognition.  And it is this power of “belief” that will release mineral nature in the future from the spell of immobility.  Hence it is written in the gospel that with faith - even if only the size of a mustard-seed - it is possible to move mountains.  
The first step toward the fulfillment of humanity’s mission of redemption with respect to hte petrified kingdoms of mineral nature is the overcoming of numbness in one’s own consciousness: the “stone” must become a dodecahedron in which all twelve streams of the cosmos are present and working together.  We want to guard against the dangers of one-sidedness and the fixed idea, and prevail upon the the human soul to contemplate and experience existence from 12 points of view.  It contains the the path of journeying through the circle of the twelve.  .  


Twelve outlooks

1. Materialism (scientist) - I only accept material proofs; my attention is turned away from myself and directed to matter. I stick to what makes the crudest impressions on me. 
2. Spiritism (lecturer) - the material is an experession of the spirit.  By developing our powers, the truth that we seek comes to us through our own inner activity.  We directly experience the spirit through thinking.  Our thinking opens out to embrace the eternal truths of existence.  Our human spirit is the part that thinks.
3. Realism (repairman) - whether the world contains matter or is a product of the mind, I know that it’s external, and I must look outward to experience it. 
4. Idealism (professsor) - the world process contains ideals.  From the world emerge ideas that i can attend to.  Without these, there is no meaning to what i see, giving the thing purpose.
5. Matemática (engineer) - the world ia a mechanical system that can be calculated.  Logic and laws to the outwer world that are united to that of the inner world.  
6. Rationalism (lawyer) - same as math but applied to all other ideas, but only those backed up by evidence found in the external world rather than those found by intuition or inspiration
7. Pyschism - 

Here's a summary of the 12 world-outlooks, highlighting the differences between each:


* **Materialism vs. Spiritism:** Focus on materialism or spiritual reality.

**Materialism:** Sees the world as purely material, governed by physical laws. They have valid explanations for the material world but deny the existence of anything spiritual.

**Spiritism:** Views the material world as an illusion or manifestation of the underlying spiritual reality. They recognize the spirit but neglect the significance of the material world.

* **Realism vs. Idealism:** Focus on the external world or the role of ideas.

S;piritism vs. idealism: the world is made of ideas vs the world is weaved through with idea.s 

**Realism:** Focuses on the external world that we perceive through our senses, without speculating about its underlying nature. They acknowledge the existence of the world but avoid questions about its essence.

**Idealism:** Believes that the world has meaning and purpose only through the ideas and ideals that permeate it. They recognize the importance of ideas but have difficulty explaining the external reality. — 

* **Monadism vs. Spiritism:** Abstract vs. concrete understanding of spiritual beings.

**Monadism:** Similar to Spiritism but in an abstract way, acknowledging spirit in the world but not specifying individual beings. They accept the presence of spirit but avoid defining their specific characteristics.

* **Mathematism vs. Rationalism:** Focus on mathematical calculations or external reasoning.

**Mathematism:** Reduces the world to mathematical formulae and calculations, seeing everything as a complex machine. They can accurately explain certain phenomena but struggle with things like consciousness.

**Rationalism:** Accepts only ideas that can be discovered outside ourselves through reason and observation, rejecting intuitive or inspirational knowledge. They expand on rational thought but neglect other sources of knowledge.

* **Psychism vs. Pneumatism:** Belief in general psychic beings or specific spirit entities.

**Psychism:** Believes the world is governed by ideas that are connected to psychic beings. They recognize the role of beings in shaping ideas but lack specific details about these beings.

**Pneumatism:** Focuses on the spiritual beings like Spirits or Hierarchies that actively influence the world. They believe in individual spirit entities but can struggle with their number and nature.

* **Dynamism vs. Realism:** Attribution of phenomena to forces vs. acceptance of the external world.


**Dynamism:** Believes that the world is shaped by invisible forces acting behind phenomena. They attribute everything to forces but don't specify the nature of these forces.

* **Phenomenalism vs. Sensationalism:** Acknowledgement of the limitations of perception vs. absolute reliance on sense-impressions.

**Phenomenalism:** Views the world as a collection of appearances and experiences without assuming it reflects true reality. They acknowledge the limitations of our perception but remain agnostic about the true nature of things.

**Sensationalism:** Accepts only sense-impressions as a valid source of knowledge, stripping away anything added by the mind. They limit knowledge to immediate sensory experiences, disregarding concepts and interpretations.

**Connections:**

Several outlooks connect to each other, revealing pathways of thought and evolution. For example, Materialism can lead to Mathematism and Rationalism, which can then progress to Idealism. Similarly, Spiritism can develop into Pneumatism and then Spiritism again through a different path.

**Overall:**

These 12 world-outlooks represent different ways of understanding and interpreting the world around us. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and some can even connect and evolve into others. The choice of one outlook over another largely depends on individual experiences, preferences, and reasoning.
