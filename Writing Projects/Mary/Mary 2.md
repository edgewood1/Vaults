1. Deleuze and his concept of folds. 
2. In the same way that a sheet of paper can be folded in half in order to hide one half behind the other, all particles, tissues, organs, and bodies are composed of folds. 
3. The hidden, or enfolded part, represents the potentials of the unhidden part.  
4. All things are in a continuous process of enfolding and unfolding.  
5. These foldings occur along the medium of a thing’s contour. 
6. In this sense, contours or borders represent much more than the difference between the inside and outside of a thing. 
7. An unfolding is the source of difference and liberating energy. 
8. Other forces counteract such an unfolding, helping to maintain the thing’s contour as well as its nature (the sum of its potentials).  
9. In a sense, what gives all things identifiable shape comes from this counter force.  
10. This force affects both material and psychic space.  
11. In psychic space, this force encourages us to maintain certain psychic routines and perspectives.  It prevents us from changing these, from assuming a new perspective that might encourage a different mode of analysis or thinking.  
12. This force has been given many names.  Foucault calls it fascism.  It’s fascism (ie, a sort of authoritarianism) that maintains the shape of reality, but also fixates us on particular views of reality. 
13. When we physically move, especially in unconventional ways, we increase the likelihood of a perspective shift on a topic. 
14. However, such a shift, requires a sort of will-working or grace.  
15. Grace is the intervention of other non-human wills upon one’s own; this might be achieved through prayer. 
16. Peer pressure is the intervention of other human will.
17. Will-working, is the conscious asserting of a view and the working with and resolving the resistances towards this position.  

Part 2
1. Palestine/ Israel have had a similar unresolveable tumultous history for as long as I can remember.  Probably at the heart of this crisis is the endless lines of authoritarian-types that attempt to lead the innocent masses into hardship.  
2. Examples? 
3. Syria, Lebanon, Egypt don’t want Palestinians because with them come provacatuers.  Iran don’t want them because they are convenient pawns in the region.  
4. These seem to populate the world wreaking pain - Putin, etc. 
5. They exist across societies and in households. 
6. within each person.
