**Ambiguous Threats:** 

Thanks for the list! We just got back Friday afternoon. I was hoping to meet up, but I've injured my hip/back and have had to rest.

What you're saying makes sense—I might try reading a novel. I have *Annihilation* (VanderMeer) here, so I could start with that. VanderMeer also compiled the "New Weird" anthology, which I'll look into.

I also found a couple of extensive lists of weird novels online, which I could try to send this week.

I'd appreciate a clear definition of Weird Lit, even from Wikipedia. It seems, superficially, to be any speculative fiction that challenges conventional literary elements.  Here are some additional features I found online: 

Weird fiction often 
* features threats that are not easily categorized or understood, evoking a sense of unease and cosmic dread. These threats may be supernatural, alien, or defy conventional explanation.
* prioritizes creating a sense of atmosphere, often dark, unsettling, and dreamlike. The focus is on evoking emotions like dread, awe, and curiosity rather than relying on jump scares or gore.
* frequently subverts or reinterprets traditional horror tropes, such as ghosts, vampires, and werewolves, or introduces entirely new kinds of monsters and entities.
* has as a common theme cosmic horror, which emphasizes the insignificance of humanity in the face of vast, indifferent cosmic forces and entities
