# Mary / Folds


1. Deleuze and his concept of folds.
2. For deleuze, reality is organized around the principle of folds, and everything is constituted by folds.  
3. The outlines of objects are expressions of folds in space, which aren’t just static boundaries, but dynamic processes that create metaphysical layerings within the object. 
4. Space, rather than being an empty container, is actively shaped by folds, which create different regions, connections, and possibilities within space itself.  
5. Social norms fold social space, creating different areas of access and exclusion.
6. Reality isn’t fixed or pre-existing, but rather a continuous process of folding/unfolding.  
7. There are rigid folds and fluid folds. 
8. The folding process creates variation and difference. 
9. We are not objects traversing a pre-existing static space, but rather both are constituted by folds.  We navigate through these folds, following their contours and possibilities. Movement is a form of folding and unfolding .  Likewise, our experience, memory, and cultural understanding.  
10. Subjective and objective folding / space is constantly intertwined.  Subjective folding are influenced by phsyical folding.  They overlap.  No absolutely objective space since it is influenced by pesepctive.  Objective is the framework while subjective is the richness of detail.  Objectively measurable properties might involve some interpretation.  Waving my arm through the phsyical space creates subjective space intertwined with objective movement, and since we are embodied observers, we experience both spaces tgehter.  Your past experiences and emotions fold onto that physical movement, creating your unique understanding.  The objective properties of your physical movement are there, but your subjective experience folds onto them, giving them meaning and personal significance.  Our interaction with the physical is always mediated by our subjective folds.  
11. As things and subjectivity folds and unfolds, it creates unique connections and interpretations as it engages with new spaces (rather than seeing it as passively occupying fixed locations).  
12. Perception of an object is a form of my personal folds enfolding upon the objective space 
13. Subjective spaces are partially shared and unique.  A unique subjective space is the result of what memories or feelings we impose/connect / fold onto the object of percpetion, which itself contains its own folds. 
14. Through conversation with another person, we can gain insight into the folds of another. 


1. The world is space and objects.
2. A fold represents the way space is bent and structured to give rise to form.   Form is the outline of an object.
3. The outline implies a hiddden depth contained within the shape, a turn towards hidden dimensions wherein lie the subjectivity and dynamism of seemingly simple structures.
4. This applies to both physical but also metaphysical / ontological reality.  
5. Folds are dynamic, constantly unfolding and revealing new depths.  It emphasizes the process of becoming and transformation.
