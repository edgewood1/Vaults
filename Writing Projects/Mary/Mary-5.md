I think our circumstances are partially the result of nature and humanity. While inherently good, they are also marked by strains of disorder and trauma that are passed down through ancestral inheritance. This inherited inertia, a limited worldview born from ancestral traumas, has a pre-determining effect on our lives.

In this context, magic could be imagined as a transformative practice—a set of actions that can change our relationship to these things. It serves as a disruptive intervention that breaks these inert cycles, allowing us to see reality differently and seek aid and healing from its better aspects.

But this got me thinking about the difference between magic, prayer, 

Magic can be contrasted to prayer and positive thinking and a journey of faith.  They all have this in common: transforming one's reality and relationship to the world.

Prayer as a Unitive Practice

In The Way of the Pilgrim, the protagonist's practice of the Jesus Prayer as a method of union with God through ceaseless repetition of a sacred phrase. It has the effect of calming the mind, focusing the heart, and purifying the spirit. 

Its goal is not to change the external world but to change the practitioner, bringing their will and heart into perfect alignment with God's. 

This aligns with our discussion about magic as an internal transformation—a change in perception and being, rather than a manipulation of others.

Positive Thinking and Subjective Magic

One form of subjective magic is what’s practiced by the positive thinking movement, which Mitch Horowitz has discussed in detail.  

They believe that by a disciplined use of imagination and faith, you can bring about change in your external circumstances. It's a form of willful consciousness, where the mind's power is the primary tool for shaping reality.

If a person prays for a job or a healing, this might feel like a form of positive thinking—a request to a higher power to bring about a desired outcome.

Likewise, the positive thinking movement can be seen as a secularized version of prayer, where the focus is on a universal law of mind rather than a personal God.

In terms of the Pilgrim's prayer, the goal is surrender, and the purpose is to conform to God's will, not to get something from Him.

In subjective magic, the power is believed to come from the individual's consciousness, and the purpose is to mold reality to their desire.

Both can be seen as "magical" in the sense that they are disciplines meant to change a person's relationship to their circumstances. However, the Pilgrim's approach is about uniting with the "better aspects" of reality (God) and allowing that union to change him. 

The subjective magician's approach is about using his own will to manipulate reality's "better aspects" for personal gain.

The Pilgrim transcends conditioned behavior through devotion, while the subjective magician addresses it by willing a new reality into being. The path you choose depends on whether you believe the ultimate power lies in surrender or in will.

subjective magic is essentially positive thinking, but the distinction lies in the underlying worldview and the intended purpose. While both practices use the power of the mind to influence reality, they come from different traditions and operate with different assumptions.

Positive thinking, particularly in the vein of the New Thought movement, is a more secular and psychological approach. It's often focused on personal empowerment and the belief that a positive mental attitude can attract good fortune, wealth, and health. It operates on the principle of a "Law of Attraction," suggesting that thoughts are vibrations that create a resonance with a universal, impersonal force. The goal is to align your thoughts with a desired outcome to manifest it in the external world.

Subjective magic, which has roots in Hermeticism and modern Chaos Magick, shares many of the same techniques as positive thinking, such as visualization and affirmation. However, it's framed within a more mystical or occult context. The key difference is that subjective magic is not just about a psychological law; it is often an explicit acknowledgement of the magician's will as a force that can interact with the subtle, unseen fabric of reality. The practitioner is not just "attracting" a desired outcome but actively creating or influencing it through a focused act of will and imagination. The magical worldview often includes a richer symbolic language, an engagement with archetypes and a rejection of a purely materialistic universe.

Key Differences
 * Worldview: Positive thinking is often a psychological tool, while subjective magic is a spiritual or metaphysical one.
 * Agency: Positive thinking sees the individual as a co-creator working with a universal law, while subjective magic sees the individual's will as the primary creative force.
 * Application: Positive thinking is generally aimed at personal well-being and material gain, whereas subjective magic can be applied to a broader range of goals, including spiritual awakening, artistic creation, or philosophical insight, as we discussed with 

Alan Moore and Grant Morrison.
In essence, while they use similar tools, subjective magic is positive thinking with a deeper, more intentional philosophical and mystical layer. It's about not just believing you can change your life, but about believing that your will is a powerful instrument of change.
