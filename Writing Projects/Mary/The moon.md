# The moon


Oh, this is great.  I agree.  It reminds me of what I’ve been writing about recently - this distinction between part and whole; how the whole is impossible to grasp, yet it exists.  How we only ever grasp something in parts.  And thus the importance of not just imagination, but a clear and forgiving imagination.  

The lunar obscures aspects of the sun’s light until the right person is ready to see what it can offer.  It’s like the guardian on the threshold.  If it did not withhold an accurate estimation until we are ready, it might be wasted on us, or it might represent missed opportunity or it might overwhelm.   

It’s hard for me not to think of the duality of the high priestess, which i think Tomberg (meditations on the tarot) also associates with the duality/reflection, and how a person’s thought doesn’t often become real or its worth isn’t truly appraised until it is shared with a peer.  For me when a thought is shared with another it comes closer to completion, and the importance of the other.   Maybe the desire for sharing discoveries and art have a possible end in helping us move closer to this heart of communion.  

Tomberg says the moon is the domain of the astral world / psychic reflection: dreams, images, illusion  - it mediates between pure spirit (sun) and material reality.   The sun is illumination, and the moon reflects this through the imagination and unconsciousness.  When this reflection (the imagination & unconscious) is more purified, it serves god.  This is the sign of the mystic.  When it is clouded, it leads to deception: the sign of the medium.  Thus, he claims this fork: the moon can be a bridge between heaven and earth or a labyrinth of illusion, a hall of mirrors.  It depends on the caller. This is why, when dabbling in these spaces, a high moral orientation is required.  

I haven’t read Tomberg in a long time, but would like to look into it if your ever game.  Like reading a chapter a month or something.   He associates the moon not with biological femininity per se, but with the soul’s capacity to receive, conceive, and give form to spiritual light.  I can see some people using menstruation as an analogy for the need for soul cleansing and renewal.  

The moon’s light waxes and wanes, the soul’s ability to reflect divine light ebbs and flow - it’s inevitable that it becomes stagnant as we accumulate impression and desire, things that we might want to regularly release.
