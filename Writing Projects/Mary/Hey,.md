# Hey,

Hey, 

Thanks for this.  I’ve not considered the trigrams in a couple decades and did not know about Baguas until you mentioned them, and Kathy elaborated a bit since she learned about them from the Stephen Skinner book. 

One thing that immediately stands out to us is the geometric pattern resembles the diagrams seen in astrological birth charts, which brings me to wonder if some astrological tools might apply here? 

In astrology, we connect the planets with lines, and the angels revealed by the lines (aspects) have symbolic meanings — for example, 180° implies tension or polarity, while 120° suggests ease and natural flow. In the case of a Bagua, would Heaven moving from 0° to 135° suggest dynamic transformation or internal tension? 

Reorienting the diagram so that the axis of the SW-SE wall becomes N-S makes the image more symmetrical. 

This raises the question of how a trigram is associated with a direction.  Traditionally, the two are statically joined.  Water is associated with north.  It is not associated with south.  

But what if upon observation of our own environment, we notice water associated with the south (due to a lake, or a fountain, or a fish tank), and other trigrams associated with other diections, would we be creating a new bagua? Would all trigrams need to be used (not necessarily)?  Could this new bagua be overlaid with a canonical one, yielding a new diagram, new angles (angels?) to be read/contemplated?  Could this reveal spaces that are auspicious for certain practices or moments? 

It’s coincidental that this topic came up.  I was just writing on the relation between Aristotle’s qualities & elements, which likely correspond with the trigrams.  I could try to share more about that later.   It’d be cool to look into alternative cosmology sources for other approaches.
