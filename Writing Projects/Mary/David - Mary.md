Thanks for the response, David.   You’re absolutely right that much of this system was shaped by cultural context and that it’s not meant to be taken as literal geography. The image of water flowing east from the northern plains is a helpful reminder that these associations often begin as symbolic, even if they’re later mapped onto physical environments.

That said, I’m still really interested in the tension between the ideational and the sensed — especially in how overlay systems (like the Bagua) interact with real, tangible spaces. I think you put it well: we live in several worlds at once. And while traditional Feng Shui may not formally “redefine” the Bagua in the way I was experimenting with, I’ve been wondering about what happens when we diagram the differences — when what’s *actually* present in a space (like water to the south) is in energetic tension with the expected symbolism.

I was just reading about how modern Feng Shui is largely dominated by ideational models — especially compass-based systems like Flying Star — and how this contrasts with older approaches that focused more on the physical environment. Apparently there’s a traditional split between what’s called the Form School (which reads the landscape and observed features) and the Formula School (which applies symbolic patterns and time-based systems). That divide really clicks for me — especially because it reminded me of the split between tropical and sidereal astrology. 

As you know, the tropical is tied to a symbolic zodiac anchored to the seasons — a kind of ideal model — while sidereal keeps track of where the constellations *actually* are in the sky. Both systems are valid, but they reflect different ways of reading the world: one through an abstract lens, the other through observed conditions. That same kind of split seems to be at work in Feng Shui — between classical map-based readings and more intuitive or responsive ones.

To me, the gap between the map and the felt seems rich with interpretive potential. Not as a way to overwrite tradition, but to engage with it creatively, almost as a diagnostic or exploratory tool. That’s the spirit in which I’ve been sketching out the geometry created by overlapping the two Bagua — a kind of cosmogram, not to define truth, but to contemplate relationships.

Thanks again for your thoughts — this really helps me clarify what I’m trying to get at.
