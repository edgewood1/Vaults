## Overcoming the Cosmic Chill of Numbness

A pervasive numbness grips all things in the cosmos - constellations, planets, stones, even the air.  

*** By numbness, we mean immobility of a metaphysical sort - a lowering of consciousness.  Stones move due to external forces, but they lack the self-directed movement associated with overcoming numbness - however, the particles have inner mobility? But only to a degree - they ultimately obey the law that enables macro-objects to manifest

This inner and outer stagnation creeps into our own minds, whispering of fixity and rigidity (immobility)

*** examples of that numbness - dogmatism (clinging to one belief systems and refusing other viewpoints), intolerance (lack of openness to diverse ideas or experiences), intellectual laziness (unwilling to engage in critical thinking), routine and repetition (getting stuck in habitual patterns of thought and behavior).

** bulllies exemplify this because they hold rigid views about themselves and others, viewing them through simplistic categories like weak or strong.  This lack of nuance and empathy prevents them from understanding the perspectives and feelings of their targets. They also don’t like to change their behavior, even when told about the negative impact.  They resist personal growth.  They also show limited flexibility in their thinking and responses.  They rely on a narrow range of tactics, like aggression or intimidation, instead of adapting their approach to different situations or individuals.  This rigidity contributes to the predictability and monotony of their bullying behavior. They wield power over others in static and oppressive ways, using it to control and dominate rather than inspire or lead.  They also engage in repetitive and unimaginative forms of aggression, relying on tacktics they’ve seen or used before.  This lack of creative resourcefulness mirrors their numbness. 

*** Bullies fall into the general category of antisocial personality disorder (disregard for others, impulsivity, and aggression, manipulation, lack of empathy).  Also narcissism - inflated sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and striving to control and power over other to fulfill their self-inflated ego.  Authoritatriansism - a strong belief in obedience to authority and traditional values.  They might see themselves as enforcers.  Machiavellian’s - deceit to achieve personal gain.  

But within us flickers a counterforce, a potent spark yearning to crack this icy shell and unleash a torrent of mobility. 

This nascent force mirrors the cosmic energies that sculpt galaxies and breathe life into mineral slumber. It whispers, "Move."

To practice movement, we practice perspective-swapping.  As an example, the zodiac is used as an all-encompassing model, that can depict, among many things, a holistic range of perspectives.  

We are not meant to stand mesmerized beneath a single star, its glare blinding us to the symphony of light around. 

To cling to one perspective is to be blind to eleven. This one-eyed way breeds the "fixed idea," the immovable stone in the garden of thought. 

Instead, we should refract the full spectrum of the zodiac onto the canvas of our understanding. Only then can we truly see, only then can we truly be.

We must become weavers, nimbly interlacing the warp and weft of these twelve cosmic concepts. 

Such dynamic perspective shifting is called “beleif”not a rigid adherence to one spark, but a dynamic dance through the constellations. It is this kaleidoscopic journey of faith that holds the key to unlocking not just ourselves, but the very stones beneath our feet.

***Belief involves the ability to move fluidly through different perspectives.  This dynamism implies a willingness to constantly re-evaluate your own beliefs and embrace new info that might challenge them. (So lack of belief is adherence to one view).  

*** Belief contrasts to knowledge.  - knowledge might solidify you in a single perspective, belief encourages continuous movement and exploration.  This openness allows you to incorporate new information and experiences, constantly adapting and refining your beliefs.  Belief is a form of inner revolution, transformation of consciousness that liberates your from the limitations of fixed ideas.  This ability to shift perspectives.  Belief means also actively engaging with these perspectives.  

*** Belief and faith are similiar 
- belief is dynamic and open minded, a process that requires focus, but it also suggests trust and commitment and assurance in the process, the willingness to explore beyond the pale, all of which stems from deeper faith in the possible ty of finding higher truth and meaning. 
- Belief might be the intellectual / exploratory aspect of faith, while faith implies more the trust, commitment, and assurance underlying th belief.  

The mineral kingdom, frozen in time, awaits its redemption. We, with our newfound mobility, hold the torch. As we break free from the numbness within, our "I" transforms into a dodecahedron, its facets reflecting the liberated light of the cosmos. This inner revolution ripples outward, a tremor that cracks the petrified Earth and births a future where mountains crumble and stones sing. The path lies before us, twelve threads woven into a single journey. Step onto it, wanderer, and dance with the stars.


There is a force that holds things together, keeps things from flying apart.  However, this force also bleeds into our consciousness, encouraging a fixity of perspective. 

There is a counter-force that encourages degress of mobility.   The idea is to latch onto this force.  

Existence is a whole, which is exemplified by the circle, and the zodiac, which is the circle bisected into 12 aspects, is the model for depicting all the elements within the whole.
