# Hey!

You’re right, it isn’t necessary to label Alan Moore as a chaos magician if he rejects the term. I was suggesting that his approach to magic and art aligns with the general definition of chaos magic. My intention was to highlight the congruence between his methods and chaos magic's core tenets, even if he doesn't identify with the term himself.

Chaos magic is a modern, flexible practice that isn’t tied to any single dogma or tradition. It pulls techniques and beliefs from a wide variety of sources, including traditional ceremonial magic, pop culture, and personal invention, based on what works for the practitioner. The focus is on results rather than adherence to a specific system. Given that Moore began with traditional ceremonial magic and later created his own syncretic system to achieve specific creative and personal goals, his practice strongly mirrors this definition.

I suspect his rejection of the label may be due to the negative connotations of chaos magic, which is sometimes associated with more frivolous or even malevolent practices, often for personal gain like money and power. He likely doesn't want to be lumped in with those who might trivialize or misuse it.

I agree that all art, when it succeeds, can be seen as having a "magical" quality. The artist invests psychic energy, and the work can affect the world. 

Doing this isn’t necessarily a bad thing unless the artist is misguided, and the “wrong-headedness” quote implies that Moore doesn’t care what guides him so long as it produces “good” art.  Were some dark overlord the source, he’d likely be ok. 

This contrasts sharply with artists who invest great effort in discerning their creative sources to align their work with their highest values. For them, the goal is not just to produce great art but for the creative process itself to be a form of spiritual or personal alignment. For example, authors like **Toni Morrison** and **David Bradley** engaged in deep, often painful, self-reflection to create works that sought healing and insight, a process that went far beyond mere artistic production.

This is a stark contrast to authors who choose simpler, more harmful solutions, such as conforming to narrow standards of beauty or severing ties with one’s heritage or advocating for genocide. 

I guess this enters into a space of moral criticism of art, which can be tricky.   I agree that there is a broad spectrum here and that most authors or artists can be absolutely aligned with the highest good or purest evil - and a deconstructive reading can draw out contrary undercurrents in any text.

I agree with your distinction between an elite lineage and an elitist mindset. The issue isn't in having access to a specific tradition or knowledge base, but how that access is used.

My point about elitism was a psychological observation.  When someone invests heavily in a practice that they believe improves their life, they can develop a bias that it can help others, and can potentially be superior to others, and that most should adopt it. This is a subtle form of elitism that can manifest in any field, from CrossFit enthusiasts to practitioners of esoteric systems.

I didn’t mean to suggest all practitioners are elitist.  Rather that the demanding nature of a specialized practice can, in some cases, foster a sense of being on a less-traveled road. 

It’s sad that while many teachers genuinely aim to share their knowledge, the traditions and groups that follow them (like those you mentioned, Crowley's O.T.O., etc.) have historically been exclusionary and hierarchical, which is an undeniably elitist characteristic.

I also appreciate your suggestion to consider Formal vs. Spontaneous Magic.  I wonder about an example of spontaneous magic.   

Speaking of other taxonomies, tonight i happened to pick up a book on Lovecraft and Crowley, and I turned directly to the author’s own unique classification, which I can share at a later time.  Earlier, I mentioned Ramsey Dukes, who has his own "big four" categories: magic, art, religion, and science that he distinguishes among them in his book “Ssbotbme”.   

And agreed! It’s a joy to be able to talk about these ideas with you.
