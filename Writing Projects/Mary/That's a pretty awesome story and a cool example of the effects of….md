That's a pretty awesome story and a cool example of the effects of some kind of magic.

As you pointed out, these events aren’t the result of magic you performed. It seems mostly something that is noticed.  Your role is that of a recipient  - where you experience the effects intentional magic from someone else, perhaps a benevolent act to send money or luck your way?  

Could it also be the effects of a certain unconscious performance, or a form of karmic feedback—the world acknowledging your kind actions - reaching out in some way, at this moment?

They certainly read as a series of synchronous events. The pompom, the money, and the young man's presence felt like a sequence communicating something to you, showing you, at the very least, that there's more to reality than random chance.  

I’m not very familiar with ways of working with synchronicity.  People have always just told me they were events that signaled I was on the right path, but that seems to be missing much truth.

I had a similar, meaningful coincidence unfold for me in the past year.  Sadly, I forget the details of it, but it seemed to speak to a desire I had to get out more, and it left me with the question of what else I might do to follow up on that desire and the signal I'd received. 

A part of me wanted to start a conversation with whatever desire, intention, or entity associated with the experience.  

I could have pursued successive follow-ups to see how my life might change.

Assuming there are intelligences that surround and guide us, I might have attempted to see and consult with them on the experience, say on a weekly basis.  

I think a big part of that sort of work is consistency, cultivating a theme of consultation or meditation, that runs like a thread over a long period of time.  That’s always quite difficult.  It's something I've rarely been able to pursue!
