# Mary2A: Aquinas, Crowley, and tomberg on magic

## 


Aleister Crowley defined magic as "the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will."

By "will", he meant one's true, unconditioned, and higher will—not simply a fleeting desire.  for him, we are ruled over by a “conditioned” self (false self) and we must find our true “unconditioned” self.  

Aquinas also defines two wills
* divine will - econpases all creation and is never mistaken. The unchanging will of god.  The universal plan that orders all of creation, and it is the source of all goodness and being.  It is he will that moves the sun and the stars and that directs every creature to its proper end. 
* Human will is a created faculty of the soul.  It is the power to choose freely between different goods, and its most fundamental object is the puruist of the good.  All human will natural desires what is good, they do so imperfectly and often get it wrong.  When we get it wrong, this is a failure of the intellect, not the will itself  when we choose unwisely, it’s because our intellect has presented something as good that is not truly good  this failure is a direct consequence of a disordered will, whic aquinas would attribute to sin.  
* Aquinas saw the intellect and will as two intertwined faculties of teh soul - the intellect’s job is to discern and present the object of choice to the will.  It judges what is good and what is not good.  The will’s job is to choose what the intellect presents.  It is a rational appetite that is naturally inclined toward the good.  The will can never choose what it knows is bad.  The error happens when the intelllect, due to some defect, presents a false good as if it were a true good. 

While both Crowley and Aquinas posit two wills - Aquinas sees the higher will as an individual thing that we might possess, while Aquinas sees the individual as only ever possessing one will.  the other will is a larger one in which the smaller will fits in.  So we might see how we fit into a larger plan or theme, and then attempt to refashion our thinking to conform to this larger plan and make choices accordingly.  In this journey regardless of where we are on, we still do the human will - we are primarily modifying our thinking.   To this end, we need help of grace and society.  The human will can never be perfectly unconditioned on its own due to Original Sin. The journey is not about self-realization, but about sanctification—a partnership with God's grace to heal our flawed nature and bring our will into harmony with His.

For Crowley, the goal is for the individual's finite True Will to achieve perfect, unconditioned liberation. The focus is on self-discovery and the complete fulfillment of one's unique, personal destiny. It's a journey of self-realization.  He argued that the magician's work is to discover their True Will and then bring their entire being into alignment with it.

Crowley is saying that we have a conditioned self—the ego—which makes choices based on external influences, and that this constitutes a false will. Through magical and spiritual practices, we can purify this conditioned self, allowing our unconditioned self to emerge. Once we discover this authentic, unconditioned self, we can make choices that are in alignment with our true will, which is our unique, personal destiny. The goal is a state where we "mostly choose correctly" because our choices are no longer driven by ego but by our essential, true nature.

For Aquinas, the notion of an individual will apart from the universal human will is nonexistent. However, the idea of an individual destiny or purpose does exist. It's not a separate "will," but a specific, unique role that each person is called to play within God's larger plan.

Human Will vs. Individual Destiny
 * Human Will: As we've discussed, this is the universal, fundamental power to choose that all people share. It is a shared faculty of our nature.
 * Individual Destiny: This is your unique path in life, which is a particular expression of your human will. It is your specific part in God's universal plan.

Aquinas believed that God has a specific plan for every individual, a unique "good" that they are meant to pursue and contribute to the whole. This is a person's individual purpose, and their pursuit of it is an act of their human will. So, while the faculty of will is the same for everyone, the way each person directs it is unique and constitutes their individual purpose.

Finding Your Purpose

According to Aquinas, discovering your individual purpose is not about finding a hidden "will" but about using your intellect and will to discern what is truly good for you and for the community. This involves seeking to understand God's will and aligning your life with it through virtue, prayer, and reason.
In this way, your purpose is not to act independently, but to act as a crucial and unique part of a greater, interconnected whole.

A Definition of Magic Based on Valentin Tomberg

A definition of magic based on Valentin Tomberg's body of knowledge would be more centered on prayer, redemption, and the spiritual-alchemical transformation of consciousness through grace.

Magic, in Tomberg's work, is not a means to impose one's will on reality but rather an act of redemptive participation in the divine order of creation. It is the conscious and willed engagement of the human spirit with the spiritual hierarchies that govern the cosmos. Unlike Crowley's focus on individual will, Tomberg's magic is about aligning oneself with the Will of God, which he saw as the ultimate reality.

This can be broken down into a few key points:

 * Redemption: Magic is fundamentally a redemptive act. It is a work of healing the "fallen" world by infusing it with divine light and grace, which is made possible through human consciousness.

 * The Power of the Heart: Tomberg argued that true magic emanates from the heart, which he saw as the seat of conscience and intuition. It is a work of love and self-sacrifice, in contrast to any form of manipulation or coercion.

 * Grace and Prayer: Prayer is the most direct and powerful form of magic. It is through prayer that an individual receives grace, the supernatural aid from God, which enables them to participate in the redemption of the world.

 * A Rosicrucian Path: Tomberg's "magic" is a path of Christian esotericism. It is a path of inner spiritual development that works with the subtle forces of nature and consciousness to bring about a world where human reason, free will, and the divine will are in harmony.

In short, for Tomberg, magic is not about "causing change to occur in conformity with will," but about allowing change to occur in conformity with grace.

Two kinds of magic
* action-oriented - a series of act that enable force
* Magic as force - an on-going expression

Kinds of will
* divine will - god’s ability having chosen the best universal plan in which we are all players
* Human will - our ability to choose the good
* True will - when we have achieved a right place from which we continuously choose correctly - this  implies an intellectual state where we always present the right options, allowing us to choose correclty
* False will - what we think our role should be.  Here, our intellect present 2 wrong options, and we choose the better of two evils. 

Orientations to will: 
* divine cooperation - with the Irvine will.  We become an instrument of grace rather than a cause of power.  We operate though faith, prayer, and love.  Can Can include symbolic or ritual forms, but the efficacy lies in *obedience to divine inspiration*.  Its highest expression is **miracle** — divine action through a purified soul. Inner formula: thy will be done.
* Neutral curiosity - Exploration and participation in the lawful correspondences of the cosmos — symbols, rituals, natural energies, or the power of imagination.
*  **It is the domain of** ***technique*** **rather than grace.** Works with natural or psychic laws (“as above, so below”). Can take two modern forms: **Ceremonial or invocatory magic:** conscious rituals meant to contact or direct invisible powers (angels, elementals, etc.) **Psychological magic:** modern will-based techniques — visualization, sigils, “manifestation,” positive thinking, chaos magic. **Neutral but unstable. It becomes sacred when subordinated to love and divine will; it becomes black when driven by pride or desire. On the “psychological” question:** Tomberg holds that imagination is a ***real bridge*** **between worlds. Even operations that seem purely mental are never empty — every psychic form tends to attract a corresponding** ***being*** **or** ***elemental influence*****. Thus, “psychological magic” can easily become invocatory in fact, even when unrecognized.**Egoic manipulation  - Use of spiritual or psychic forces for self-assertion, domination, or curiosity — “my will be done.”
*  **This is the** ***perversion*** **of the other two forms. Characteristics:**	•	Employs similar techniques as ceremonial or psychological magic, but for personal power or fascination.	•	The operator becomes enslaved to the forces he or she commands.	•	Results in spiritual inversion and bondage.

## 
**I. The Magic of Grace** *- (Sacred, Transcendental, or The Magic of Love) -* **Tomberg’s view: This is** ***true*** **and** ***holy*** **magic — the “magic of Christ,” where freedom and divine will coincide.
Examples:**
	•	Theurgy as understood by saints and mystics.
	•	Healing or inspiration that arises through surrender and compassion.
	•	Any act of love that transforms reality without coercion.

**II. The Magic of Knowledge or Form** *(Natural or Ceremonial Magic — conditionally legitimate)* **- Tomberg’s principle:** “There is a magic of works and a magic of grace. The first is lawful only when it remains humble before the second.” (*Letter I: The Magician*)

⸻
**III. The Magic of Ego** *(Black or Sorcerous Magic)* **- Tomberg’s definition:** “Every magic which does not take the divine will for its supreme law is black magic.” (*Letter XV: The Devil*) **Inner Formula: “*****I will; therefore it is done.*****”**

**The Axis of Discernment: Will vs. Faith**

**Orientation**	**Operative Word**	**Spiritual Polarity**	**Result**
**Faith-centered**	“Thy will be done.”	Obedience and communion	Miracle / sacred magic
**Will-centered (self-assertive)**	“I will; it shall be.”	Pride and separation	Sorcery / black magic

	•	*Faith-centered magic* opens upward, aligning human freedom with divine initiative.
	•	*Will-centered magic* closes inward, seeking mastery through the psyche’s own forces.

**Category**	**Sub-types**	**Power Source**	**Orientation**	**Outcome**
**I. Magic of Grace**	Sacred, Transcendental, Love	Divine will through grace	Surrender, love, faith	Miracle, sanctification
**II. Magic of Knowledge/Form**	Ceremonial (invocatory); Natural (cosmic correspondences); Psychological (will, imagination)	Natural and psychic laws	Conditional—depends on humility or pride	Either cooperation with grace *or* slide into black magic
**III. Magic of Ego**	Black, Sorcery, Luciferic	Human will and lower spirits	Domination, curiosity, pride	Obsession, moral and spiritual decay

**Core Principle**
## 
“Every magical operation stands at a crossroads:
it ascends to miracle when the will bows in love,
and it descends to sorcery when the will asserts itself in pride.”
— *paraphrasing Tomberg’s synthesis of The Magician and The Devil*

Would you like me to add a short paragraph showing how Tomberg relates these three orders to the **three temptations of Christ — turning stones to bread, testing God, and seeking worldly power? He uses that symbolism to show the inner purification of the Magician into the Saint.**
