I also don’t know enough about astrology to coordinate celestial bodies to Earth coordinates.  In retrospect, it does seem a bit ambitious.  Ultimately, using stars as a symbolic system would simply be a way of ordering memory if it began to feel disordered. Astrology and Kabbalah are useful in this regard because they contain so many numerological levels

I tried playing with a map (see attached) and a legend (below) to explore these ideas. 

Long ago, I began a memoir about a small window of my life.  It quickly became episodic and meandering—like random snippets of a life going nowhere. I tried imposing Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey, but while intriguing, it felt like a distraction and didn’t fully resolve the structural issues.

As for the crossover with earth coordinates in birth charts, I think location is mostly used to calculate the ascendant, the zodiac rising on the eastern horizon at that moment, etc.  But this significance is tied to the specific location and narrow window of birth and doesn't inherently comment on the enduring qualities of the place itself. However, I’ve seen some use a city's incorporation/chartering date to glean insights into its significance.

I came across Guy Debord’s definition of psychogeography: "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment…on the emotions and behavior of individuals.” A key exploration tactic is the *dérive*—a purposeful urban drift

This reminds me of Lawrence Halprin’s *The RSVP Cycles*, which outlines a similar system for creative collaboration with urban and natural settings, , including unique urban walking tours.  

These tours emphasized sensory engagement that sought to reveal hidden patterns and relationships to help designers envision more “democratic spaces”. 

It seems Halprin’s and Debord’s ideas somewhat parallel in their to disrupt routine urban perceptions. Debord’s *dérive* emphasized randomness to uncover subjective layers of a city, while Halprin’s tours used structured “scores” for creative exploration.  But it seems Debord’s psychogeography had a more revolutionary, anti-capitalist focus, critiquing urban alienation. Halprin focused on community, ecological awareness, and participatory design. The *dérive* was unstructured; Halprin’s tours used flexible frameworks.

My early life trajectory revisited a few places: My parents were born in Puerto Rico, a place we visited but never lived. We moved to Panama twice, the East Coast twice, and Germany once. This roughly forms a triangle with Puerto Rico at its center

* **Panama (down-mercurial/Water):** Its watery climate and southern location give it the quality of water—emotions, warmth of the Spanish language, life, movement, oceans, and beaches.
* **Germany (up-mercurial/Air):** Its organized, metallic urban landscape is air—associated with detachment, perhaps even introversion, and negative change.
* **North Carolina/Maryland (salt/Earth):** Highways across grasslands with patches of trees represent earth—associated with dryness, stability, the coldness of the English language, death, salt, stasis, and enclosure.
* **Puerto Rico (sulfur/Fire):** As the triangle’s center, it represents fire—dissolving judgment, resurrection, rediscovery, transience, positive change, family, and connection.

This seems to use the 4 elements, but only 3 cardinal directions/alchemical principles.  I googled if there were any systems that only used 3 cardinal directions, and apparently there were a couple.  

Polynesian systems for ocean navigation uses seaward, leeward, and windward.  So it’s in relation to the force of wind.  Aboriginal Australian cultures  used up, down and across (rather than east-west). 

But instead of directions, the alchemical principles or those of time (past, present, future?) or something else could be used?
