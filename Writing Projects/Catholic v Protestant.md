# Catholic v Protestant



Authority & scripture

* Sola Scriptura - Bible is the sole infallible source of truth.  No human (including a pope) or council is error-free.
* Bible functions alongside Church traditions and the Pope.  Authority rests on three pillars: scripture, sacred tradition, and the magisterium (the teaching authority of the church, led by the pope). The Holy Spirit guides the church specifically to interpret the Bible correctly over time. 

Salvation
* Sola Fide - salvation by faith alone through grace alone.  It is a one-time act.  We commit good works because we are saved; good works don’t lead to salvation. 
* Salvation is achieved through faith and works working together.  It is also a process where the believer cooperates with God’s grace through faith, participates in the sacraments, and good works.   What does this last sentence mean? cooperating with grace is a good work, participating in sacraments are good works, etc.  The Protestant believes if we believe in god, but don’t help others, sin even, don’t participate in sacraments, we can still be saved? 

Sacraments // Number
- [ ] Protestants only recognize two sacraments: Baptism and communion, arguing these are the only 2 instituted directly by Jesus in the Bible.  
- [ ] Catholics celebrate 7.  Baptism, Eucharist, Confession (related to good works), Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, Matrimony, and the 7th? Also do Protestants do not see matrimony as a sacrament? 
Sacraments // Eucharist
* Most believe Christ is present in, with , and under the elements (consubstantiation) wil evangelicals and baptists view it as purely symbolic or memorial act.  And isn’t this belef an extension of the idea that grace and nature are contrary - or that <u>**nature is the means of achieving grace, that we can only know grace through the natural world.**</u>Catholics believe in transubstantiation: the bread and wine literally transform into the body and blood of Christ, though they retain the appearance of bread and wine.  Does this relate to the notion of primary and secondary substance? That a woman appears the same (primary substance) but as secondary substance / essence might change from that of single to married woman? That all things have two aspects - their presence and what their presence is? 

Church structure and priesthood
* protean reject the authority of the pope, saying each person is a priest, meaning every Christian has direct access to God without needing a human mediator to confess sins to.  This speaks to the disbelief in good works, and by extension, confession as a sacrament.  If we don’t need human mediation, why do we need mediation in general, and why do we need Christ if god is present? And are all Christians of sufficient stature under god that any can be priest? This again speaks to the uselessness of good works, or works in general.  The role of action, ritual, deed.  
* Catholic - Pope is the Vicar of Christ and successor to the Apostle Peter.  Only ordained priests administer the sacraments.  They mediate.  <u>**In general, the earth, the natural world is the means by which we can access the spiritual world.  This is the principle of mediation.**</u> 
Mary and Saints
* Catholics venerate (honor, not worship) Mary and saints and ask for intercession (prayers) in the same way one might ask a friend to pray for them.  Analogy, there are some things we feel more comfortable talking with Mary or a saint vs Jesus, ie when addressing Mary or a saint, they may bring out a different aspect of ourselves that Jesus or God might not.  Who is Mary? Who is this Saint? 
* Protestant reject praying to saints or Mary, believing that prayer should be directed solely to God through Jesus (so god does require the mediation of Jesus for them)?

Purgatory
* Catholics believe in Purgatory, a temporary state of purification for those who die in God’s grace but still need to be cleansed of the effects of sin before entering heaven.  All religions have this? 
* Protestants reject purgatory, believing believers go directly to be with the Lord upon death.  it seems this is also related to the good works issue. 

=====

It seems so many of these difference are related to the good works issue.  Protestant don’t’ believe in purgatory because they dont want to be held back by a lack of good works, and a lack of works or certain paths walked should not be enough to hold someone back from acting as a priest, and thus there are no holy orders, and confessions are not needed because works are not an issue.   Only faith is important (and yet, isn’t this a deed/work).  Finally good works aren’t needed to achieve salvation.  The only difference that doesn’t directly involve good works is teh view of the Eucharist, which involves the role of mediation, that nature is not necessarily the means by which grace can be known.  But if we associate nature with the physical world, the body, and the idea that a person can have direct access to grace despite the body’s actions, then it also relates to the works issue, correct? If this is also true, what is so bad about including good works? This whole schema can’t be just because at one point works allowed one to bypass faith? 

Protestant argue that faith is a gift from god, not a decision by man.  Thus it is not a work.  But if you remove human cooperation entirely, we are just robots without free will.  




What instigated the Protestant movement? 
* Luther - insane?
