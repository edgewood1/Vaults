# Prayer politics


1. How effective is traditional political work like canvassing? 
	1. Canvassers use an app that extracts votes based on a digitial map that steers towards a small portion of the population, missing the reality of the situation. 
	2. In many states, a win of 3 percent is 100K+ votes. 
	3. Yet canvassing can make a diffference in voter turn out, but it is not effective in changing sides.  It motivates those who tend to vote for their party to vote: for every 16 people who might have not voted that a canvasser talks to, 1 would vote.
2. What are two approaches to politics. 
	1. Canvassing is an oppositionally-oriented tech ice.  It is premised on us vs them thinking, and that if a person pulls enough levers to effect an outcome.   This is partially true because the zeitgeist can instill an apathy 
	2. Non-transactional its. 
3. Layers of the political (micros hardens into the macro)
	1. Upper layer (macro/molar)- consists of two parts: Repesentational - metrics / media.  Sedimentary - hardened lived experience (zeitgeist?)
	2. Under layers (micro/molecular)- A wave of desire / affect not yet hardened.  The level of production - the living present.  Desires fears, hopes constantly circulating beneath datapoints of a map.  Not yet hardened: fluid, chaotic lava flow.  The micropolitical.  
4. What is the upper layer-Sedimentary / Zeigeist?
	1. these voters are already steered based on experience from last several years.  This is the zeigeist, the spirit of the age.  Zeigeist - a 100 cause built over a 1000 days.  Equivalent to a person’s character, cultivated over alifetime of habits.  This isn’t going to be rewritten  by a single conversation.  
5. Where do these two views fit: 
	1. that in which we are in complete control of our future.  (What to call this view).  
	2. that in which we are overly-determined by history (and potentially the influence of the celestial realms - which, being time based, might somewhat relate to history?)
6. How to see the canvasser in light of this.  
	1. Delusion of the canvasser: they believe they are agents of change, but internally, they have calcified identities that imagine the possess the truth.  One side is correct, the other side is not.  This often prevents us from finding a viable solution, which is often found though a middle-ground approach between the two sides. Also, when a calcified canvasser or protester meets a calcified voter or institution, you don’t’ get a flow, you get a collision.  Noise and conflict.  
7. Another kind of political activity
	1. Protests
8. Protest has two aspects. 
	1. Opposition ally oriented - modern protest functions on the molar - engages in caricature of teh other side reinforcing us vs them gridlock.  They often further entrench sides despite the fact that can allow participants to connect with community and dissolve their own sedimented feelings of helplessness; however, it directs this connection in a negative direction.   
	2. Radical non-transactional amity.  Civil right movement operated differently - by committing to non-violence, they refused the transactional script of you hit me, i hit you.  It was a form fo spiritual theater that didn’t just bang the rock of racism but sought to melt it through a display of dignitity and shared humanity - two sets of values absent in modern protest. 
9. Another kind of “political” activity.  Is this arguable? This will be the second section which we won’t go into here. 
	1. Artistic approaches aligned with acts of radical non-transicatinoly witll be listed In this next section.  This approach, of which civils rights movement might loosely fit, are those that have no utility, price tag, or enemy.  They break the logic of scarcity - they are forms of gift, generating a surplus of love and hope that other forms can’t.  This will include approaches by Dadaism, surrealists, situationalists, etc.
