Nature of God (Pure Act)

God is pure act.  He lacks potency.  He is infinitely real. In Him, there is no division between “being” and “doing”; to be god is to act as god.  

**The Unity of the Knower and Known**


1. Subject - the space of thinking
2. Act of thinking - to attend the object with the intention of knowing more about it.
3. Object of thinking: that which is thought amount - it doesn’t participate in my knowing other than as passive bystander.  
4. Idea -the mental picture of the tree - an idea/concept - that the thinker experiences
5. Knowledge - what we call teh idea if it conforms to reality.  Truth is conformity of mind with reality
6. Three ways the mind can conform with reality: direct contact (sensing the window), self-evident principles (grasping a definition), or proof (reasoning from A to B  have knowledge.  
7. Understanding -  the host of inferences we naturally draw about our invoked idea / knowledge.  

Applications

1. When I look into the mirror, I see a reflection of myself. 
2. This reflection is not myself, although it represents a sliver.  So in thinking about this reflection, I only think about a sliver of myself, which is really something else entirely.  
3. Does the ideas creates by the mind analogous to the reflection created by a mirror? Partially.  Ideas go further in that they invoke inferences - understanding.  But if we supplied this - or if this were a magic mirror that, in addition to offering a reflection, also offered insights and understanding, then it would be analogous. 
4. The nature of representation is that the object represented is never fully reflected.  We can only achieve more or less authentic relationships, more or less counterfeit. 

Divine Analogy

Though God is one simple reality, we distinguish three aspects of his intellectual life to grasp its fullness.  

1. God is primarily a thinking being. 
2. The main object of thinking is his own essence. 
3. God is unique in that he is simple.
4. If a person thinks of himself, he is really thinking about a passive representation of self, which is not himself.  Is this due to the complexity that arises from our dimension? I am complex.  This means I am composed of parts.  And I can never see or know all my parts at once.   
5. If god thinks of himself, he thinks of his essence, which is himself.  (Why would this be different? Is this due to his simplicity? Can we have a chain of logic?)
6. God is simple, not made of parts.  Thus he cannot know himself partially. To know Himself at all is to know himself absolutely or not at all. 
7. If subject and object of thought are identical, and the subject is a pure act, then object is pure act.   
8. This object is infinite, so it is capable of infinite ideas - called essences.    Because these ideas conform to the reality of god, it represents the knowledge of god.   
9. Does understanding, the inferences drawn from ideas, apply in this dimension?  
10. God is the knower, the act of knowing, and the thing known all at once.  

Because the object known is identical to the knower, and both subject and object are pure act.  What is a pure act? Are all acts of knowing pure? 

 =====================================

*Metaphysical principle II: Form & Matter

(3)* • Note on Possibility: To be a "possible," a thing must contain no contradiction (e.g., a unicorn or blue-leaved tree). Contradictions (circular squares, married bachelors) are not potential; they are impossible non-entities.

**Principles**

when I see the tree, i notice it’s branches and leaves.  

Substance: A complete, independent reality that exists in itself and acts as a subject (e.g., a tree, a dog, a rock, an angel). It is the "whole thing" available to the senses and cognition. (Note: An idea is not a substance because it depends on a mind to exist).

Integral Part: A constituent of quantity consisting of the physical "chunks" that make up the body of a substance. These parts, such as the branches and leaves of a tree, are spatially distinguishable and can be physically severed from the whole.

Metaphysical Part (Principle): A foundational block that structures reality—such as essence, existence, form, or power—which is real but not an independent object. A helpful analogy is the steepness of a hill: while the hill is the object (substance), the steepness is a real principle that has physical effects (causing you to roll), yet it cannot be dug out or separated from the hill like a rock could.

Accident (Quality): A modification or attribute of a thing that depends on the substance to exist. It typically describes the condition of the object, such as the greenness of a leaf, which can change or be lost without destroying the substance itself.
Proper Accident (Proprium): A specific type of quality that flows necessarily from the essence of a thing. For example, the roundness of a ball is technically a quality of shape (an arrangement of parts), but because a ball is defined by this shape, the roundness is functionally essential; if the roundness is lost, the material remains, but the "ball" is ruined.

Idea: A mental representation that exists as a quality of the mind rather than as an independent substance. While it is not a principle of the external object (it doesn't make the tree exist), it serves as the principle of knowledge, or that by which we know the object.

**The Primary Principles: potency and act**

The fundamental framework of reality, the primary principle, is that relationship between Potency (capacity) and Act (fulfillment). 

These are the broadest possible principles; everything else is just a specific application of them.  

Potency is defined as the capacity to be or to do something different than what is currently happening, while Act is the realization or completion of that capacity. 

These two modes of reality manifest differently depending on which field of existence we observe.

**The three fields**

**Field of Being**

When applied to the most basic Field of Being, Potency is called Essence (the capacity to exist as a specific kind of thing).  

Essence is a principle of potentiality, not a potential thing; it is not a "ghostly object" waiting to be born, but the definition that structures the potential for a specific kind of reality. 

Act is called Existence (the act of being itself).  

**Field of Matter**

When applied to the Field of Physical Substance, these principles function as Intrinsic Causes because they reside inside the thing.  Here, Potency is Matter (the stufff waiting to be organized), and Act is Form (the organizing principle).  Together they combine to constitute substance.  

**Field of Action**

When applied to the field of Action, Potency is called Power (the capacity to do).  A Power is a faculty that exists even when not in use—for example, a human has the power to think even while sleeping.  the power is present as a capacity, waiting for the operation (the act of thinking) to fulfill it.

Act is called Operation (the actual doing).  The Operation is the active exercise of that power; when the person wakes and thinks, they fulfill that potency

**The Causal flow of power: From Soul to Operation**

The Primary Substance (the actual object) serves as the subject where these powers reside

Substantial Form (soul) - principle of actuality that determines essence. 

Essence - source of active powers (growth, sight, thought). 

Powers - source of operations: because an object has the essence of an Oak, it necessarily possesses the power to grow leaves.

**Causal priority belongs to Essence**

The potency to exist (Essence) must precede the potency to act (Power), because a thing must possess a specific nature before it can possess the specific abilities that flow from that nature. These principles are not independent objects like coins in a purse; they are real aspects of a thing’s nature—like the roundness of a ball of wax—which determine reality but cannot exist apart from the substance they structure.

**Logical Priority**

In logic, we begin with the widest possible category (genus) and move to the specific type (species).  Potency/Act is teh widest, essence is a kind of potency, and power is a kind of potency.  

But in reality (the system of causality), essence is first.  The tree exists as an Oak, because it is an oak, it has the power to grow leaves, and because it has the power, it actually grows a leaf.  

Conclusion

These principles—form, essence, and power—are physically real aspects of a thing’s nature, yet they are not independent objects. 

Much like the roundness of a ball of wax, they determine reality but cannot be removed from the ball; they are the principles by which the ball is round, not objects residing inside it.

Principle > object (sensual order) …. Ideas (logical) 

**Principles of Action (Powers & Operations)**

Two fundamental principles of all created things are potency (powers) and actuality (operations).

A Power / potential  is the inherent capacity or faculty to perform an action.  It exists even when not currently in use. Because you are human, you have the power to think even when you are sleeping.

An operation / act is the active exercise of power.  It is the actual activity or doing.  It is the fulfillment of a power.  If I have he power to think, and I think, I fulfill this power.  

**Source of Powers**
 
Essence (formal cause of powers) —(determines)—> active powers (such as growth, sight, and thought). 

An oak essence means this object has the power to grow leaves.  

Substantial form (soul), which is the principle of actuality —-> Essence

Essence itself exists in the primary substance, the actual object, which is the subject of the powers, the place where the powers live.   

**Grades of powers potentials.**  

Act and potency are primary principles, being the widest possible categories of reality.  Everything else is just a specific application of act an potency.  

* Potency/act applied to being is essence/existence.  Essence is the potency to exist.  It is not a potential thing (a ghostly object), but a principle of potentiality.  

* Potency/act applied to the physical substance is matter/form.  Matter / form are intrinsic causes because they are inside the thing.  Material Cause: The Potency (The stuff waiting to be organized).  Formal Cause: The Act (The organizing principle).  Result: They combine to form the Substance.

* Potency/act applied to field of action is power/operation.  These often apply to qualities? Growing is an act (operation) and the ability to grow is a power (potency).   
In this sense, act/potency is the primary principle from which all other things are variations.  All prinicples are variations of act and potency.  

**Causes**

2. The "Extrinsic" Causes (The Outsiders)
These two are outside the thing. They don't combine to make the object; rather, they interact to produce the object.

Efficient cause is the thing that makes the object, It possesses the active power to change the matter and reduce it from potency to act. ￼(what does that mean?)

Final Cause is The Goal / reason of the Act.  It determines why the efficient cause acts. ￼It moves the Efficient Cause to act. (The carpenter doesn't build unless he has a goal of a table).

* so final cause motivates the efficient cause, and the efficient cause motivates the object made.

Efficient and Final causes explain motion and change, while Matter and Form explain structure and being 

***Metaphysical Principles I: Essence & Existence***

Essence and Existence are two inseparable principles of anything.  
* Essence (The Potency): It is both the idea / definition of a thing and its potential to exist.  
* Existence / Esse (The Act): It is the act / reality that makes the definition actual.

Two kinds of acts
* Existence itself - unrecieved, unlimited pure being.  The sun itself.  First act (to be) - be fore a tree can grow, it must exist. 
* Tree’s act of existence: created limited act; it is real but received from god.   The sun beam form the sun.  This is borrowed light.   Second act.  To do.  This is the operation (growing).  This flows form teh powers of the primary substance. 

when essence receives existence the result is a single independent reality of the tree (primary substance). 

 **3. Contingent Being**

A thing composed of Essence and Existence is a Contingent Being, an object whose existence depends on factors outside itself.
• The Rule of Act: "If a thing possesses an 'act' (like existence) that is not part of its own definition, it must have received that act from another."
• Because a tree's definition (essence) does not guarantee that it exists (it could be imaginary), its existence must be a gift from a source. If that source is removed, existence is lost.

 4. The Two Kinds of Essence
There is a fundamental divide in reality based on the relationship between essence and existence:
• Type A: Essence is Distinct from Existence (Creatures).  In these beings, what they are is different from that they are.  There are many of them; they are dependent (contingent); they receive their existence from a source.
• Type B: Essence is Identical to Existence ( The Source / God).  In this Being, its very definition is "to exist." It cannot not exist. There can be only one; it is independent (Necessary); it is the source of all other things; its being is shared by all things without being diminished. 


 5. The Soul, Death, and Resurrection
The human soul (the substantial form) possesses a unique relationship with existence.  When the body dies, the soul retains the "act of existence" it received. It continues to exist without the body. However, the soul is still a contingent being. Its existence is not its own; it is sustained by the Source. If this existence were revoked, the soul would undergo annihilation (total erasure from reality).  While the soul persists, the person (the Primary Substance of Body + Soul) is broken by death. It is possible for the act of existence to be granted again to the composite of soul and body. This reunion is called the Resurrection 

Poetic
 
It’s clear to me that you exist.  The evidence is in the parts that compose you: the roughness of your bark, my sensation of it as I brush the tips of my fingers across it

Essence and existence combine to form primary substance: you, the entity standing before me.  

If we remove your existence or your essence, then you are no longer present. 


## **Chapter 3**
*Metaphysical principle II: Form & Matter*

**Immaterial objects (should this come after Wonder Woman)**

Matter
* individuating element
* A dogwood describes an essence, but the inclusion of matter results in a specific dogwood.
* John and Mary share human essence, but their matter individualizes them to actualize same attribute to different degrees.  So while both share intelligence, Mary might have more intelligence. 


**Immaterial objects**
* lack the individuating element.  Does that mean angels are not individuals? 
* If this were true in our world, there would only be one dogwood, and it would be immortal (lacking the principle of degeneration that is matter).  And there would only be one maple.  But maples and dogwood probably share more attributes than differences - would the difference between two angels be more extreme? 
* Dogwoods and maples are trees.  Would “trees” be a category much like an angelic hierarchy is? And there are 9 angelic orders in the hierarchy.  Does that mean there are only 9 categories of immaterial substances other than god? Or is the number 9 an arbitrary one.

In contrast, Superman and Wonder Woman, with their radically different natures and powers, are incomparable. The difference between them is not one of degree but of kind.

**Angels**

More spiritual intelligences than physical. 
These creatures are called “angels”, “gods”, “devas”. 

These creatures have wide-ranging powers.  
One such power might involve their duty to nature. 


For example, Angel has duty to oversee the entire life cycle of a forest & its overall health and vitality, guides the forest's growth, decay, and renewal.  This duty reflects God's will and the forest's final cause, 

However, such a duty might be complex, involving a hierarchy of extended powers.  
* These extended powers can be poetically and conceptually broken down / anthropomorphized into a series of smaller, more specialized "entities."  “nature spirits”, lesser beings.   This hierarchy of powers express an aspect of angel’s will. 
* Is it possible that these lesser beings in fact become distinct over time through the attention of humans.  Also consider egregores.  

Example
* Archangel Ariel provide the spiritual impulse.  Ariel might carry the following associations to the earth king + elementals): 
* elemental kings (King Ghob) interpret and carry out these impulses (representing the archangel’s will to manage the forest. ).  They direct individual elementals.
* Elementals - nature spirits - these are still extension or functional identity of angels singular will.   For example, a gnome-like spirit could be the term for the power to manage the mineral health of the soil, while an undine-like spirit could represent the power to regulate the flow of water.
* At the lowest level are the life-giving spirits whose duty is the most direct and specific. A dryad-like spirit could be the term for the power to oversee the growth of a single tree, representing the Archangel’s will at its most focused and intimate level of influence.

**Angelic Power (this is a different breakdown).**

Some nature spirits govern certain areas / population of reality while others are more intelligent.  
* Group souls govern populations while nature / regional nature spirits govern locations or objects.   
* Elemental kings command while elementals forces/primal spirits act.   
* Elementary …. ? 
* Elementals - work at the junction between spirit and matter; People can influence them wiht their thoughts and feelings. (Suzanne Bovenizer).

**Physical vs Non-physical perspectives**

When I experience the world, the experience begins with the physical.  While thoughts are part of the world, they are also about the physical world.  

Our reality is primarily physical. 
* Representations, such as stories or paintings, and ideas are only real relative to the physical and the physically-anchored minds that host these ideas and representations.  
* Or is this true? Because thoughts can exist in angelic beings? But likely not the same kind of thoughts that are in our minds. 
* While for us, hte primary reference for reality is physical, spirits have theirs as the non-physical: ideas and representations.  A spirits would see an idea as more real than a physical object.  A spirit would see us as an idea or representation - they would see only our essence?  


## **Existence**



In Shakespeare's famous soliloquy "To be or not to be", Hamlet debates between the known torments of life and the unknown terrors of death.

But this phrase, apart from its context, could also be read as an inquiry into a thing’s nature - a thing might have being, or it might not. 

**Principles of Causality (Efficient & Final Cause)**

And how did this tree even get here?

The chain of Efficient Causes - 
* Secondary causes: The squirrel that buried the acorn, the parent tree that made the acorn, and the sun and rain that nourished it were all proximate causes. These are agents.
* Ultimate, independent cause: God, who is the ultimate source of all power and being.

Final cause - 
Final cause moves secondary causes (agents).  The tree is here for a purpose: to grow to maturity, to bring forth new seeds, to provide shade and shelter for other beings, and in doing so, to express and reflect the goodness of its ultimate Creator. The tree's very existence and all its actions are directed toward this final end.
**Universal / particular**

A universal is a quality that can be shared by many things (e.g., "red" applies to all red objects).

 A particular is a unique, individual thing that embodies universals (e.g., a single red apple).

Kinds of concepts
* particular of a single thing
* Substantive - refer to real things
* Accidental - refer to qualities 
* Imaginative - lack real reference
* Simple - all of the above
* Logical - describe rules of thought and reasoning - if/then, and all.  They organize thought to draw conclusions. 
* Relational - help organize / understand relations between simple concepts - father is a relational concept defining a relationship to a child.  Cause/effect, and genus/species are others. 

**Three degrees of reality**

<u>Conceptual Reality</u>
* This is the realm of mental objects, including ideas, concepts, and figments of imagination. 
* Some of these correspond to things in the world, and others don't. 
* Mental objects can refer to physical (trees) or other mental objects (unicorns?), and they can refer to many things (trees) or a single thing (that tree). 

<u>Substantial Reality</u>
* These are individual, existing things, which are always particular. This can be physical (tree, or rock) or immaterial (angels, disembodied souls) 

<u>Divine Reality</u>

This is not a category of things, but the source and foundation of (connection between) all being.  

**Language / Signifiers**

Signifiers: words, musical notes, symbols.  

The word "tree" refers to a concept, which refers to a substance.   Symbols require concepts to connect with substance. 

Words in our mind have conceptual reality.  It is the mental utterance of a concept, the way th intellect expresses a concept.  Mental words allows us to hold and think about a concept without speaking or writing. 

An essence is considered a secondary substance, but can a concept also be?  

Abstraction - moving from observed object > concept > word.   We see a thing, and we glimpse its essence, which is represented as a concept, to whihc we assign a word or some other symbol.

Signification - moving from word > concept > observation. 

How true a word is depends on how well it reflects our internal words / concepts. 


* A primary substance -  an individual, existing thing that is independent and can stand on its own. Examples include a specific human, a particular tree, or a single rock.

* A spoken or written word is a physical event (sound waves) or a physical object (ink on a page). While it exists in the world, it is not a primary substance because its very nature and purpose are to be a sign that points to something else. It doesn't have an independent essence in the same way a person or a tree does. Its reality is entirely dependent on its relationship to the concept and the thing it signifies.



**Word > concept > Essence** 
* A concept has only conceptual reality
* an essence has substantial reality? A thing's substantial reality has two inseparable aspects: essence and existence. The essence is the "whatness" of a thing—its defining nature. 
* This essence exists only as a part of a primary substance, the individual, existing thing. You can't have an essence without a primary substance.


**Primacy**

Primary substance is an external sign. 
It is given primacy over internal signs (concepts, essence, thoughts, etc). 

Derrida:
Speech and sound seem closer to us because it is physical.
Because meaning and thought seem private and silent and immaterial, it seems more removed. 


Derrida: truth isn’t a fixed state of correspondence between words, concepts, and things.  

Truth is a fluid and unstable concept.  
A word’s meaning isn’t in a self-contained concept
It is always deferred and defined by a chain of differences with other words.  
There is no final, foundational meaning or “logos” to which langauge refers.  

Thus, 
* physical objects only get their meaning from other such objects.
* Concepts get their from other concepts. 
* Objects don’t defer to concept.  
* And there’s no fixed arrangement between these - only socially agreed upon ones? But that seems limiting since clearly a toxic substance can kill us - this is not something we agree upon.  

He does not believe: 
* there’s a pure, uncorrupted thought-word in the mind that is seperate from the system of language itself.  
* There is not the notion that concepts are stable, fixed mental objects.  Their meaning, he woudl say, is always in flux, defined by their differences from other concepts, just as words are.  
* langauge doesn’t reflect reality in a mirror like relationship, but rather langauge is self-referential - it constructs through a play of difference.  Truth is not a matter of accurate reflection.  It is a constantly shifting effect of a langauge system that has no origin or end.  

When we speak or write them, they assume substantial reality.

**Deconstruction**

Aquinas: 
* God is completely transcendent and independent of the created world, 
* God is the source of all created elements.  
* Language ultimate defers to this source. 
* Words and concepts have meaning because it refers to this essence, which refers to this ultimate truth and reality int he mind of god.   
* Because we are made in the image of god, we can come to know these truths & can abstract the essences of the world.  

In Mahayana Buddhist metaphysics, 
* There is no ultimate independent source. 
* All things are inter-dependent. 
* Nothing has an independent, unchanging essence.  
* Everything is empty of a permanent self or substance.  

Does having no ultimate essence imply a lack of permanent self / substance? 

In this context , language is inherently self-referential. 
* words don’t point to a transcendental truth or a fixed essence or essence. These are distinct dimensions.  

Instead, language is seen as a source of clinging and illusion because it creates the very idea of a seperate self and independent things.  

But how does word referring to words as opposed to essences create the idea of self as seperate from independent things? 

Thus, there is no ultimate truth to be found in words.  
* this implies words are empty.
* The ultimate truth is experienced directly, not described by langauge. 
* But in this context, are images themselves self-referential, and thus prone to the same emptiness? 

the west prioritizes the internal sign as primary over the external.  … stop here because: 



**Extraneous**

Words are signs that point to something. 
* Some words, like "tree," point to a concept—a mental representation of an essence found in the world. 
* Other words, like "and," are organizing signs that don't point to a concept.

Nonsense words, such as "blurg," are also conceptual realities, but they don't point to a concept. They lack a corresponding meaning or essence and are not based on substantial reality, though they may still evoke a feeling. 

Concepts, in a philosophical sense, have to do with true meaning, while nonsense words do not.


Yes, there is a direct etymological and conceptual relationship between the angelic order of **Principalities** and the philosophical term **"principles,"** as both derive from the same Greek root, *archē* (ἀρχή). 

## **Etymological Connection**
* **Principalities:** The English term "principality" is a translation of the Latin *principalitas*, which itself comes from *principalis* ("first in importance; original, primitive"). This Latin term was used to translate the Greek word ***archai*** (plural of *archē*) in biblical texts (e.g., Ephesians 6:12, Colossians 1:16) that mention this order of spiritual beings.
* **Principles:** In philosophy, the English word "principle" is also derived from the same Latin and Greek roots, referring to a **beginning, origin, or fundamental cause**. When philosophers speak of "first principles" (like the principle of non-contradiction) or the principles of essence, form, and matter, they are speaking of the foundational elements or causes from which other things derive their existence, order, or knowledge. 

## **Conceptual Relationship**
The conceptual link is found in the idea of **origin, beginning, and fundamental rule/governance**. 
* **Philosophical Principles** (essence, form, matter, etc.) are the intrinsic or foundational causes that constitute the being of a substance and determine its nature. They are the "first things" in the order of existence.
* **Angelic Principalities** (the *archai*) are understood in Christian angelology (specifically in Pseudo-Dionysius and Aquinas) as the spiritual beings who hold a "first" or chief place in the governance of the world. They are the **originators or first-level administrators of divine order** for earthly affairs, such as nations, cities, and human institutions. They preside over the lower orders of angels, directing them to carry out the divine ministry. In this sense, they act as the *operating principles* of order and governance in the material world. 
In essence, both terms stem from the idea of a **foundational, primary, or ruling element**, whether it's an abstract philosophical concept that explains existence or a celestial being that enacts divine governance
