# The intersection of prayer and politics


Is traditional political work like canvassing actually effective? Or is it delusional to think we can change outcomes from pulling a lever.  

To understand this, we have to define what "political work" actually looks like today. A modern canvasser isn't just taking a neighborly stroll; they are executing a highly engineered, data-driven logic. They stare at an app (like MiniVAN) that generates a "Turf"—a curated map where half the neighborhood literally doesn't exist. Relying on algorithms and consumer data, they are instructed to hit specific "pins" (likely supporters) and aggressively avoid the "sleeping dogs" (the opposition). They aren't engaging the territory; they are engaging a database.

It strikes me that this approach—trying to surgically extract votes based on a digital map—completely misses the "Zeitgeist." The Zeitgeist isn't just a mood or a vibe; it is the sheer, hardened reality of the situation. 

It is the result of a thousand causes building up over the last thousand days. Such a heavy reality is not going to change due to a few weeks of targeted app-walking any more than a person’s character, cultivated over a lifetime of habits, can be rewritten by a single conversation.

In his "micropolitical" analysis, Deleuze defines this heavy reality as the Molar field. It is composed of two hard layers: a representational layer (the rigid grid of the canvassing app, the polls, the parties) and a sedimentary layer (the 1000 days of history hardened into habits). This is the crust of reality—the accumulated weight of economics and institutions. The app is a snapshot of the past; the habit is a repetition of the past.

In contrast, the Molecular is the level of production—the living present. It consists of the unformed desires, fears, and hopes that are constantly circulating beneath the data points on the map. It hasn't hardened into a habit or a statistic yet; it is the fluid, chaotic lava flow of micropolitics. The Zeitgeist is simply what happens when this molecular lava cools down and congeals into rock.

The mistake the canvasser (and often the protester) makes is viewing the opposition as an object that must be moved by force—using arguments, scripts, facts, or shouting. 

But because the Zeitgeist is heavy, the rock doesn't budge. Worse, they believe they are agents of change, but internally, they have calcified themselves into a rigid identity that imagines they possess the Truth. 

The result is that when a calcified canvasser meets a calcified voter, or a calcified protester screams at a calcified institution, you don't get a flow; you get a collision. Two rocks banging together just creates noise and conflict.

We see this distinction in the history of protest. The modern protest often functions on this Molar level—engaging in caricature of the other side and reinforcing the "Us vs. Them" grid. 

However, the Civil Rights movement operated differently. By committing to non-violence, they refused the transactional script of "you hit me, I hit you." It was a form of spiritual theater that didn't just bang against the rock of racism but sought to melt it through a display of dignity and shared humanity. 

Even today, the only real power in a protest might be the internal molecular shift—the moment a participant connects with a community and dissolves their own sedimented feelings of helplessness.

This brings me to the idea that if we want to act effectively, we could shift from conversion (hitting the rock) to connection (melting it). This is why Art, Gratitude, and Prayer are so potent: they are acts of Radical Non-Transactionality.

In a world where much is defined by deals (Capitalist Realism) and war (Right-Wing Hyperstition), the most effective act is one that has no utility, no price tag, and no enemy. 

These acts break the logic of scarcity because the system assumes we only give if we get. But art creates beauty for its own sake; gratitude gives credit without losing status; and prayer surrenders attention to the Invisible without a guaranteed receipt. 

All three are forms of the Gift, generating a surplus of love and hope that the economic system cannot capture, tax, or process.


Furthermore, the system relies on us keeping our guard up as defended voters or consumers, but these acts demand vulnerability. You cannot pray, thank, or create while holding a weapon or a grudge. Performing them forces you to drop the armor of the culture war, stopping you from being a static "node" and turning you into a fluid "flow" in the rhizome. They also interrupt the "progress narrative" by suspending time. 

While the system traps us in the linear rush of deadlines and election cycles, art suspends time, gratitude appreciates the now, and prayer connects the instant to the eternal. The coherent thread here is "gratuitousness"—meaning uncalled for, unwarranted, and free.

So, praying for the opposition isn't passive; it is the beginning of a new habit that changes the invisible frequency of the culture at the molecular level so that the political outcome can finally shift. 

We see historical precedents for this in the Surrealists, who sought to unlock the unconscious to disrupt the internal discipline that obeys state control. We also see it in the Situationists, who engaged in the "drift" to break the invisible grid of the city. Similarly, Dada used cut-ups to scramble media propaganda, while the Counterculture refused to desire the "good life" the state offered.

However, we have to be careful, because the Right has already adopted some of these methods of breaking consensus reality (hyperstition). We can’t fight their spell with dry rationalism or "fact-checking," which is like bringing a knife to a magic fight. But fighting it with pure chaos just adds noise. 

The distinction lies in the direction of the irrationality. The fascist impulse uses the irrational to contract and separate, creating a paranoid "Us vs. Them" narrative. 

The Deleuzian or Hermetic approach uses the irrational to expand and connect, revealing the hidden links between self and other. 

The antidote, then, isn't to counter "War is Good" with "No, War is Bad," but to generate a counter-reality so interconnected and complex that their simple, paranoid story collapses under the weight of the new connections. We don't debunk their myth; we out-dream it with a reality that includes them in a way they can't resist.

Notes for fixing

Ok, thanks.  Your typical protester just gets a sense of solidarity - they are at home, they read the news and feel angry and frustrated and alone and helpless, and so they join a protest, and suddenly feel not alone and not helpless in their anger and frustration, and might even gain comic relief, and some of the more committed folks might meet others to form strategies for future political action, but all of this seems to be driven by an us vs them self-centered focus.  Personally, I don’t think your typical American is capable of getting beyond that.  The civil rights movement was a unique circumstance of history that can’t really be repeated.  the small peace march you sent me is cool, but this is a small Buddhist? Community leading the way, and this community doesn’t seem to have overt ties to anything typically American.
