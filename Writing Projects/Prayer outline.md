# Prayer outline


Thesis
	1. t is common for politics to assume a visible, oppositional, and transactional form; however, true transformation requires we engage in **'molecular' modes** (like prayer, art, and hospitality), because only these non-transactional acts can melt the hardened social sediment that traditional politics otherwise packs tighter."
	4. "While modern activism relies on the logic of scarcity and opposition, we must recover the power of the 'molecular'—acts of surplus beauty, private prayer, and radical hospitality that refuse to treat the enemy as a caricature and thereby dissolve the rigidity of the system."
1. "We typically view political agency as visible and oppositional, but we ignore the 'molecular' substrate of reality. Unless we first shift the invisible frequency of culture through non-transactional acts like prayer and art, our visible efforts will only reinforce the status quo

The Central Question
* "How can we effect genuine political and social change when our standard methods of opposition (protest, voting, arguing) only serve to harden the very systems and enmities we are trying to dismantle?"

The Thesis Statement
* "True societal transformation cannot occur solely through 'molar' force—rigid, oppositional politics that reinforce polarization—but requires a preceding 'molecular' shift. By engaging in non-transactional acts like private prayer, art, and radical hospitality, we dissolve hardened identities and alter the invisible substrate of consciousness, creating the necessary conditions for material justice to take root."

* Key Arguments Supporting the Thesis
To flesh this out, the outline relies on three pillars of logic:

1. The Trap of the Molar (The Problem)
 * The Diagnosis: Modern political action is "molar"—it is rigid, categorical, and oppositional.
 * The Failure: When we attack an enemy using molar methods (e.g., angry protests, partisan conflict), we unintentionally validate the "us vs. them" structure. We "pack the sediment tighter," solidifying the very resistance we hope to overcome.
 * The Symptom: We think we are wielding truth, but we are often just enacting the symptoms of a polarized time.

2. The Power of the Molecular (The Solution)
 * The Antidote: Change requires "fluidity." We must melt the hardened habits of perception (e.g., viewing the other as a caricature) before we can change laws.
 * The Mechanism: This operates on the principle that the "subtle rules the dense" (Tomberg). Politics is the physical outcome of an invisible spiritual/psychological climate. To fix the politics, you must first shift the frequency of the culture through inner work.

3. The Strategy of Non-Transactionality (The Method)
 * Expenditure without Return: The system relies on scarcity and transaction (I give to get). Acts that have no utility, price tag, or enemy—such as prayer, art, and gratitude—break this logic.
 * Vulnerability as Weapon: By engaging in prayer or sharing a meal with a "perceived enemy," we surrender our armor. We stop defending our identity as a "voter" or "consumer" and become human. This generates a "surplus of beauty" that the system cannot track, neutralize, or commodify.

Summary
The outline argues that prayer is not a retreat from politics, but the deepest form of it. It is the molecular work of softening the ground so that the molar work (organizing, legislating) can actually bear fruit.


Paper

1. There are two kinds of agency: th emolar and molecular. 
2. Molar
3. We impose order, ignore chaos, and nothing changes. 
4. Chaos = fluidity/molecular; order = molar ; reality is where the two meet. 
5. We use the molar to change the molar, but only the molecular can change it. 
6. We want to be the agent of change wielding truth (internalized molar) when we merely enact symptom of the times (actual molar). 
7. Agent of change wielding truth implies that there are others who lack this - the premise of partisan conflict.  Yet their apathy and the non-apathy person suffer from the same disease of being crushed into the molar. 
8. Oppositional stances are a reflection of the molar.
9. Molecular
10. Melt rocks or expose self to elements > become fluid.  
11. The molecular lack the mass to be oppositional. 
12. Modern protests are oppositional - they are born of hardened habits, directing energy against a caricature of the enemy.  It can only interact through impact.  While it offers a temporary internal release, it primary serves to solidify positions. 
13. In contrast, the civilize rights movement sought to undo hardened habits (if I’m hit, hit back).  Thus refusing to play out a transactional script.  In this sense, it remained fluid.  It did solidify itself into the “human”, but this is a trait possessed by both sides.  In the theater that featured the “human” being attacked, this formed a more potent image. 
14. This form of fluidity is potentes but often tethered to specific utility of laws and rights.  But there are other categories of action that have not utility, price tag, or enemy: prayer, art, gratitude. 
15. These forms also breaks the logic of scarcity: we only give if we get.  But 
16. <u>**art, gratitude, and prayer**</u> contradict these. They expend without return.  
18. Also if we melt identity, there’s less to defend.  The system relies we defend as ourselves as voters or consumers.  But these acts demand vulnerability, of putting ourselves into prayer, gratitude, or creation that requires us to put down our weapon.  And armour.  In doing so, you cease being a static node, and instead become a fluid flow in the rhizome. 
19. The system traps us in linear rush of deadlines and elections cycles, art suspends time… 

Secret power of prayer. 
1. By prayer, we mean private prayer, which operates on the molecular.  Public prayer can calcify into performance.  
2. In doing so, you do something teh system cannot track or neutralize.  
3. This act changes the invisible frequency of the culture, which bubbles up.  

Meal sharing
1. 9/11 - anti-Mulslum sentiment hardened into policy and violence.  Some communities shred meals with them, visited mosques, prayered together.  This was no transactional - it didn’t demand policy change.  It was gratuitous contact that forced vulnerability.  It’s hard to share a meal when you’re defensive.  Sharing of food becomes a ind of art, an aesthetic of hospitality.  The acknowledgment of common humanity becoming a form of gratitude.  Parallel prayers become recongnition of shared mystery.  Success not measureable in votes, but countless moments where the other’s hardened image melts back into a “person who worries about their family just like i do”.  

Consciousness rules matter
1. Tomberg - subtle rules the dense.  Prayer and internal equanimity and invisible shifts in feeling are not epiphenomen floating above real politics, they are the real politics, generative substrate from which material outcomes emerge.  
2. Private feelings matter - equnimtiy, talking about it… 
3. Grief work in the woods
The artis turns
1. Non-violent protest is tethered to laws and rights.  They are asking for something. 
2. We could also consider non-transactional exchanging, having no utility, price tag, and enemies es.  
3. Expenditure without return is potent in an economy where output demands an equivalent input, where scarcity logic rules, 
4. To give / expend without care of return is considered wasteful form their point of view, but from another point of view? 
5. An example of this act: prayer - it is a surrender of agency, it is time and attention without expectation.  
6. It can be an art form or art can be done in this way - where we listen, create from what we hear, observe what’s created, reflect, and revise.  
7. Listening implies vulnerability since we surrender guards.  It implies non-transactionality since we’re give all of ourselves to this other, implied in  a surplus given.  We generate more care, beauty, attention than the situation requires or desrves.  

Historical precedents.  
Don’t melt to fast.  Here - we liste 5 artistic movements that have had some impact on society.
1. The fluid is pure structureless flow. 
2. Direct line can cause madness / death
3. Instead a line fo flight -  a controlled release that enables change.s 
4. Fascist impulse uses the irrational to contract and seperate, create a paranoid oppositional narrarative that seals off connection
5. Alternatively, we use it to expand and connect, revealing hidden links between self / other. 
6. Ultimately, connected systems collapse paranoid ones.  How? We out-dream with a reality that includes them in a way they cannot resist. 

Conclusion. 
1. we need both molar and molecular. 
2. Some folks specialize in one or the other, but each side can find a middle ground. 
3. Our culture has cultivated more molar.  We need more molecular.  Non-oppositional.  We need more people asking am i packing sediment tighter? 

Prayer
1. Prayer is not passive, you are refusing to let them calcify in your imagination into a caricature.  Art wihtout a political message is generate ssurplus beauty that the transactional cannot capture.  Gratitude for the damnedable, is belting categories that keep us all frozen in place.  Do we have the courage to do work that goes unnoticed, that produces not immediate result? The smalle matters as much as the large, the invisible as much as the visible, consciousness rules matter.  
2. Prayer for the enemy can do more to shift the political landscape than a thousand phonecalls because it changes us at the molecular level, and we are a substrate through which all politics must flow 

Civil rights. 
1. Modern oppositional protest like collective canvassing.   I operates on the molar of hardened habits, directing energy against a caricature.  
2. Civil rights activists underwent weeks of abuse simulation…  they also made an ontological declaration, affirming a truth of who they were bypassing the other rather than attacking the other.  Slogans today are defined by negation, tithing the movement’s identity to the enemy it opposes.  And beyond the laws they seek to pass, there’s an awareness, that the real work is living in the culture that can give rise to the laws - it’s more about cultivating the courage to use facilities despite prejudice
3. Today, people are easy to mobile via social media, allowing anyone to appear and act out personal authority issues, encouraging the reactive and oppositional.  

Conclusion
* organizing, canvassing, political engagement necessary, but without molecular work to soften the ground, molar efforts just pack the sediment tighter.
