**Primary Qualities and Elemental Principles**

Aristotle's philosophy centers on four **primary qualities**:
* **Hot** (expansion, activity)
* **Cold** (contraction, passivity)
* **Dry** (concentration, fixedness, relating to **form**)
* **Wet** (adaptability, flow, also relating to **form**)
The Hot/Cold dynamic (energetic states) assumes the Dry/Wet dynamic (substantial presence and form); a thing must have being to contract or expand.
These qualities combine to form four **pure elements** (Fire, Air, Water, Earth). These elements are **metaphorical principles**, not their literal, observable counterparts. They are the fundamental, unobservable constituents of all **sublunary (earthly) matter**. Each element is defined by its unique qualities and natural tendency:
* **Earth:** Cold & Dry (tends to fall to the center)
* **Water:** Cold & Wet (tends to gather below Air)
* **Air:** Hot & Wet (tends to rise above Water)
* **Fire:** Hot & Dry (tends to rise to the uppermost sublunary sphere)
Adjacent elements share one primary quality, enabling **transmutation** (e.g., Earth (Cold, Dry) becomes Water (Cold, Wet) by shifting Dryness to Wetness). Non-adjacent elements transform through a two-step process.
Beyond defining qualities, each element is associated with broader principles:
* **Earth:** Rootedness, structure, stability
* **Water:** Receptivity, fluidity, nourishment
* **Air:** Communicativeness, expansiveness, movement, perception
* **Fire:** Transformation, intellect, activity


**Composite Bodies and Natural Kingdoms**

The pure elements mix and are organized by **substantial forms** to create all observable **composite bodies**(e.g., rocks, plants, animals). The **natural kingdoms** (Mineral, Plant, Animal, Human) represent a hierarchy of these substantial forms, each manifesting increasing perfection in organizing elemental matter.
Each kingdom is a blend of all four elements, but one or two **predominate** based on the kingdom's substantial form:
* **Mineral Kingdom:** Predominantly **Earth** qualities, conferring stability and hardness (e.g., rocks). While all elements are present, Earth is essentially dominant.
* **Plant Kingdom:** Organized by a **vegetative soul**, requiring **Earth** for rootedness and **Water** for fluidity and nourishment. Plants also integrate Air (respiration) and Fire (metabolism).
* **Animal Kingdom:** Organized by a **sensitive soul**, subsuming vegetative powers and adding sensation/locomotion. This requires **Water** for fluids/instincts and **Air** for movement/perception. Earth forms the body, and Fire provides metabolic heat.
* **Human Kingdom:** Organized by a **rational soul**, integrating lower powers and adding intellect/will. This higher capacity strongly associates with the transformative **Fire** and communicative **Air**.
Each kingdom connects to adjacent ones not only through shared elemental presence but also by at least one predominant element, reflecting a continuous hierarchy of being.
