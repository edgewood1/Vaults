The Geology of Politics: From Molar Collisions to Molecular Shifts

We often feel stuck in a political landscape that resembles immovable tectonic plates. We rely on "molar" methods—heavy, oppositional politics—to move them rather than “molecular” methods. 

The Illusion of Control: The Map and the Territory

The problem begins with the most visible form of political action: canvassing. The modern canvasser is not merely taking a neighborly stroll; they are executing a highly engineered logic of extraction. They rely on apps like MiniVAN that generate a "Turf"—a curated digital map where half the neighborhood literally does not exist. 

Driven by the reality that elections in swing states are often decided by thin margins (sometimes fewer than 50,000 votes), this technology acts as a filter. It forces the canvasser to treat people as data points to be harvested rather than complex beings to be understood. 

This work effectively boosts turnout by "waking up the choir," but it fails at persuasion because it assumes that if we just pull enough levers and extract enough data, the machine will output democracy.

The reason this lever-pulling fails is that the digital maps are only skimming the surface of a much deeper, harder reality. 

In his "micropolitical" analysis, Deleuze provides the framework to distinguish between the layers of this reality.

Theoretical Framework: The Two Layers

Political reality is composed of two distinct strata: the Upper Layer (The Molar) and the Lower Layer (The Molecular).

The Upper Layer is the realm of calcification. It is static, rigid, and formed by time. Crucially, this layer contains two distinct elements:

The first element consists of the representational elements - the metrics, the polls, and the digital maps used by the canvasser. They are the "grid" we place over the world to measure potential.

The second element consists of sedimentary elements: These are the actual political positions and habits of the populace. This is the "Zeitgeist"—a heavy, calcified geology composed of the past few years of history.

The Lower Layer is the realm of the micro/molecular. This is the molten flow of the present. It is the undetermined element—the raw, chaotic circulation of desires, fears, and hopes that exist before they cool down and harden into the sedimentary positions of the Upper Layer.

The fundamental disconnect of traditional politics is that it tries to shift the Sediment (hardened habits) by pointing at the Representation (maps and facts). It attempts to move the rock by arguing with the grid, completely ignoring the Lava (the underlying affect) that formed the rock in the first place.

The Paradox of Agency

This geological reality creates a paradox of agency for the activist. The canvasser often operates under a philosophy of Voluntarism—the belief that they are a free agent of change wielding the truth. But in reality, they are often trapped in Determinism—acting out a script written by the sedimentary layer of the Zeitgeist. Their "oppositional" stance is not a disruption of the system; it is just another layer of sediment, hardened by the spirit of the age.

The tragedy is that the canvasser tries to cure the apathy of the non-voter or the indecision of the swing voter with the conflict of the partisan. But because both apathy, indecision, and partisanship are "sedimentary" reactions to the age—calcified responses to the same history—they do not mesh.  They clash.  Instead, we might contemplate agency accessing the "Molecular" layer.

Case Study: Collision vs. Melt

We see this distinction clearly when we contrast two historical modes of protest. 

Modern oppositional protest often functions as the collective version of the canvasser’s delusion. It operates on the Molar level—which is to say, the level of solids. Because the participants have calcified into rigid identities, because this directs energy against a caricature of the enemy, they cannot flow or connect; they can only interact through impact. While it may provide a temporary internal release (shifting the participants' own sediment), externally it functions mechanically as **rock hitting rock**, which only serves to pack the opposition's sediment tighter through the pressure of the collision.

**Calcification does not always result in collision; it can also result in inertia. The cynic or the non-voter has calcified into a static boulder rather than a projectile. But whether the solid acts in an oppositional or apathetic manner, the the physics remain the same: interaction is limited to collision or blockage.**

In contrast, the non-violent branch of the Civil Rights movement practiced a form of **Radical Non-Transactional Amity**. By refusing the transactional script of history ("action and reaction"), they stopped acting like a solid object. **They did not become inert; they became fluid.** They did not just bang against the rock of racism; they sought to permeate it. Theirs was a "Spiritual Theater" of dignity and shared humanity that bypassed the rigid "Representational" logic of power (Mechanics) and spoke directly to the fluid "Molecular" undercurrents (Thermodynamics) of the oppressor.

The Artistic Turn

If the Civil Rights movement showed us that the "Melt" is more powerful than the "Collision," we might explore other forms of such amity.  Even non-violent protest is often tethered to specific utility (laws, rights), but there exists a category of action that has no utility, no price tag, and no enemy: Art, Gratitude, and Prayer.

These acts are potent because they break the logic of scarcity entirely. In a transactional world, these forms generate a surplus of hope and beauty that the "metrics" of the Upper Layer can never measure. While the system relies on us keeping our guard up as defended voters or consumers, these acts demand vulnerability; you cannot pray, thank, or create while holding a weapon or a grudge. Performing them forces you to drop the armor of the culture war, stopping you from being a static "node" on the map and turning you into a fluid "flow" in the rhizome.

These acts break the logic of scarcity because the system assumes we only give if we get. But art creates beauty for its own sake; gratitude gives credit without losing status; and prayer surrenders attention to the Invisible without a guaranteed receipt. All three are forms of the Gift, generating a surplus of love and hope that the economic system cannot capture, tax, or process.

Furthermore, the system relies on us keeping our guard up as defended voters or consumers, but these acts demand vulnerability. You cannot pray, thank, or create while holding a weapon or a grudge. Performing them forces you to drop the armor of the culture war, stopping you from being a static "node" and turning you into a fluid "flow" in the rhizome. They also interrupt the "progress narrative" by suspending time. While the system traps us in the linear rush of deadlines and election cycles, art suspends time, gratitude appreciates the now, and prayer connects the instant to the eternal. The coherent thread here is "gratuitousness"—meaning uncalled for, unwarranted, and free.

So, praying for the opposition isn't passive; it is the beginning of a new habit that changes the invisible frequency of the culture at the molecular level so that the political outcome can finally shift. We see historical precedents for these method in  the Surrealists, who sought to drill directly into the unconscious to liquefy the sediment of state control—much like Dalí’s paranoid-critical method, involving the deliberate cultivation of a paranoid state(delirious interpretations of reality) to access the subconscious, allowing for the creation of multiple, simultaneous images within one figure, often appearing as “hand-painted dream photographs" with uncanny realism and irrational meaning, challenging normal perception. It's a systematic way to induce irrational knowledge by critically interpreting and materializing subconscious connections, using optical illusions and juxtapositions to reveal hidden meanings in everyday objects

We also see it in the Situationists, who rejected the Molar grid of the city to engage in the "drift," walking the wrong way guided only by feeling to break the invisible control of the urban map.  The situationalists believed cities were designed to force us into routines; by engaging in the "drift" and walking the wrong way guided only by feeling, they broke the invisible grid of control. (It would be cool to make a map of Durham that ignored Duke and the Tobacco Campus to highlight the invisible emotional landmarks of the community instead.) 

Similarly, Dada used cut-ups to scramble the "Representational Layer" of media propaganda, while the Counterculture refused the rewards of the system entirely. 

Even Russian Cosmism viewed the ultimate oppression as death itself, ignoring elections to focus on the scientific-spiritual conquest of death and the cosmos.

However, we must be careful. As Deleuze warns, accessing the molecular layer is not without risk. If we try to dissolve the strata too quickly—if we seek pure, uncontainable flow with no structure at all—we do not get freedom; we get madness or death. You cannot live as pure lava. The goal of micropolitics is not to blow up the mountain, but to drill a "Line of Flight"—a controlled release of pressure that allows the rigid rock to reshape itself into something new.

We see this danger in how the Right has adopted methods of breaking consensus reality (hyperstition) to serve their own ends. We cannot fight their spell with dry rationalism or "fact-checking," which is like bringing a knife to a magic fight. But fighting it with pure chaos just adds to the destruction. The distinction lies in the direction of the irrationality. The fascist impulse uses the irrational to contract and separate, creating a paranoid "Us vs. Them" narrative. The Deleuzian or Hermetic approach uses the irrational to expand and connect, revealing the hidden links between self and other. The antidote, then, is not to counter "War is Good" with "No, War is Bad," but to generate a counter-reality so interconnected and complex that their simple, paranoid story collapses under the weight of the new connections. We do not debunk their myth; we out-dream it with a reality that includes them in a way they cannot resist.
