# Godfather Cheat Sheet


Name: Wilbur
Role: Spiritual Witness & Trusted Elder

Key Dates:
 * Birthday: May 3 (Saint Philip and James (The apostles) - two of teh Twelve apostles as his birthday patrons is perfect.  Philip is the curios apostle.  He is teh approachable one.  He is the one who tells his friend, “come and see” he is also the one who asks Jesus the big questions during the last supper - lord show us hte father.  
 * Baptism: December 7 (Feast of St. Ambrose – The Teacher)

**Immediate Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)**

 * Phone Setup: Create a recurring calendar entry for May 2 (Wilbur's B-day) and Dec 7 (Baptism Anniversary).

 * Tomorrow: Show up early, smile, and reassure the parents they are doing a great job.

 * The First Follow-up: Send a handwritten note next week thanking them for the honor. It solidifies your commitment in writing.
Good luck tomorrow. You are bringing history, stability, and prayer to this boy's life. That is exactly what a godfather does.


**Phase 1: The Ceremony (Tomorrow)**

 * The Vows: Expect to answer "I do" to questions about nurturing him in the faith. You are promising to help him know Christ, not to make him a Presbyterian.
 * The Conversation: At the reception, share the "Saint Date" connection with the parents.
   * Script: "I looked it up, and Wilbur has a great team watching him. He was born on the feast of St. Athanasius and baptized on the feast of St. Ambrose. Two of the smartest men in history."

**Phase 2: The Routine (0–5 Years)**

Goal: Overcome the 30-mile distance through consistency.

 * The Daily Habit: A short prayer for Wilbur. This honors the father’s Quaker background (holding him in the light).

 * The Calendar Anchor: Put May 2nd in your phone as a recurring event with a 1-week reminder. Send a card or a gift so it arrives on the day.

 * The "Check-In": Text the dad once a quarter (e.g., "Thinking of you guys, hope Wilbur is sleeping well"). No pressure to hang out, just presence.

**Phase 3: The Formation (6–12 Years)**

Goal: Become the "Cool Wise Uncle" who connects him to history.

 * The Bible Gift: When he turns 7 or 8 (reading age), buy him a high-quality, leather-bound youth Bible. Write an inscription in the front referencing St. Ambrose (the teacher).

 * The Visit: Try to attend one milestone a year (a birthday party or a school event) so you aren't a stranger.

 * The Narrative: When you talk to him, tell him stories about why Christians believe what they believe. Be the "History Guy" in his life.

**Phase 4: The Mentorship (13+ Years)**

Goal: Be the release valve during teenage years.
 * The Safe Harbor: If he clashes with his parents’ "do-it-yourself" theology, be the steady sounding board.

 * The Intellectual Resource: You are 55 now; when he is 15, you will be 70. Use that seniority. Help him navigate doubts with the wisdom of the long Christian tradition (Aquinas, Church Fathers, etc.).

**Baptism meaning**

Both Catholics and Presbyterians believe that for a baptism to be valid, it must be done with water and the specific words: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."


2. The Catholic View (What YOU believe is happening)

There are three aspects of a person: 

As a Catholic, you view baptism as Sacramental Realism. You believe God is performing a spiritual surgery on Wilbur’s soul in real-time.
 * Removal of Original Sin: You believe that before the water flows, there is a barrier (Original Sin) between the soul and God. The baptism washes this away.
 * Ontological Change: You believe the sacrament leaves an "indelible mark" on the soul. Wilbur is fundamentally changed. He becomes a "New Creation."
 * Infusion of Grace: It is not just a sign; it is a channel. Grace is poured into him, regardless of whether he (as an infant) understands it.
 * Summary: To you, this is an Event of Transformation. God is the primary actor.
3. The Presbyterian View (What the PASTOR believes is happening)
Presbyterians (and the Reformed tradition) view baptism primarily as a Covenantal Sign and Seal.
 * The "New Circumcision": Presbyterians view baptism as the New Testament equivalent of circumcision. In the Old Testament, circumcision marked a boy as a member of Israel (God's people), but it didn't guarantee he would be faithful.
 * Entrance to the Community: They believe baptism marks Wilbur as a member of the "Visible Church." He is now part of the Covenant family.
 * Sign and Seal: They do not believe the water itself washes away sin in that exact moment (regenerative baptism). Instead, it is a "Seal" of God's promise. It guarantees that if Wilbur has faith later in life, God’s grace is waiting for him.
 * Summary: To them, this is an Event of Inclusion. It is about bringing the child into the community of faith.
4. The "Independent/Quaker" View (What the PARENTS likely believe)
Since the parents are "read the Bible yourself" types and the father was raised Quaker (who generally do not baptize at all), their view is likely the most symbolic.
 * Public Dedication: They likely view this primarily as their promise to God, rather than God’s action upon the child. They are publicly stating, "We will raise him to know Jesus."
 * Obedience: They are doing this because Jesus said to ("Go and baptize"), but they may not believe the water changes Wilbur's soul. They likely believe he is "saved" only when he makes a personal decision later in life.
How this affects you tomorrow
You will likely feel a slight "temperature difference" in the room.
 * The Vibe: The ceremony might feel less "mystical" than a Catholic baptism. It will likely feel more communal and instructional. The pastor will talk a lot about the congregation's duty to help raise the boy.
 * Your Internal Posture:
   * While the parents might view this as a dedication, and the pastor views it as a Covenant seal, you are allowed to pray as a Catholic.
   * When the water touches Wilbur’s head, you can pray: "Lord, wash him, fill him with Your Grace, and make him your son forever."
   * God is not limited by the theology of the people in the room. Your prayer can bridge the gap between the "Sign" they see and the "Sacrament" you know it to be.
The Bottom Line:
To the room, Wilbur is joining the club.
To you, Wilbur is becoming a Temple of the Holy Spirit.
Both are reasons to celebrate.
