# The Molecular Politics of Prayer

We usually assume politics must be visible, oppositional, and transactional. We walk out into the street and engage others with the hopes of aligning them to our cause. We might find those who agree with us and rail against a common enemy—a group or institution abstracted into a target, representations against which we hold signs.

In all of this, we engage in the work of reduction. We flatten the other into a political position, we compress social mechanisms into slogans like “capitalism.” In this process, we also flatten ourselves to this single sentiment, reshaping ourselves into these simplified forms.

These acts of division—the lines we use to segment reality—are what Deleuze and Guattari call “molar lines.” They cut the continuous flow of reality into discrete manageable chunks: you are a man, this is Tuesday, that is the enemy. My work routine is a molar element. So is my marriage. Our culture is organized by the molar, which makes it the lens through which we attempt political change. This is molar politics.

Molar politics is obsessed with form—passing a law, winning an election, drawing a new border. It tries to impose a new shape onto society. But such forms are calcifications: static structures capturing the fluid matter of life.

But when we meet our opponents with argument and pressure, hoping to move them, we only lock them—and ourselves—more firmly in place. Methods like canvassing and phone banking, marching and protesting—all necessary, all potentially powerful—can operate in a mode of opposition. We approach others as positions to be corrected rather than humans to be encountered. We assume we are “Agents of Change” wielding “Truth,” but we are actually enacting the symptoms of an already polarized reality.

If I reduce the other to enemy, I engage only a fragment of them—the least vital and most foreign aspect—while excluding what is most alive: their molecular underlayer. Beneath the hardened form—whether of a person, movement, or institution—lies something else entirely: the raw material of consciousness, feeling, and desire. Thick, fluid, volatile, uncarved and unsegmented.

In the process, I also reduce myself. I meet them not with my full humanity but with my most defended posture, my most fearful stance. The reduction is mutual: I trap them in a caricature, and I trap myself in the very fear I project onto them. Both sides harden.

But this hardening is a process, not a permanent state. These rigid identities are products of deeper molecular forces—countless micro-decisions and mediated encounters that accumulate over time into what feels like fixed positions. The molecular is the substrate beneath the molar, the level where positions are still forming, still capable of shifting.

To change what has hardened, we must work at the level where it is still becoming

II. The Molecular Substrate

The molecular is a realm of supple lines, shifting tensions, and vague feeling.  It is the substrate that underlies the rigid forms of molar reality. This relationship reflects a principle from the hermetic philosopher Valentin Tomberg of “the subtle” ruling “the dense.” Subtle elements like consciousness and culture are what ultimately shape physical outcomes like laws and elections. Without shifts at this invisible level, new legislation merely overlays old habits.

What does it feel like to experience the molecular? It is not simply adopting a new political identity or reading the right books—that would just be trading one molar position for another. The molecular appears as moments we cannot easily categorize: a sudden awareness that our anger is covering fear, an unexpected recognition of ourselves in someone we thought was other, the way a chance encounter undermines certainties we’ve held for years. These experiences disrupt our established positions without offering a new position to occupy. This is disorienting because it requires staying in uncertainty rather than rushing toward a new certainty.

Consider the difference between molar and molecular politics: two people debating political views, each trying to reshape the other through argument and force - this is molar politics.  But imagine instead a person who has a dream that shifts their entire understanding, a molecular transformation—something subtle (a dream, an image, an encounter) dissolves what seemed solid and creating new possibilities from within.  This is molecular transformation, change at a level of the substrate rather than form.

Such transformations sometimes happen to us unbidden. But we can also create conditions that invite them. Through practices like prayer and art, we engage the molecular directly. These acts work by indirection rather than force, receptivity rather than control. Prayer offers attention without demanding outcomes. Art explores without insisting on answers. Gratitude acknowledges without calculating what should follow. In this posture of openness, change becomes possible—both in ourselves and, subtly, in those we encounter. As the hermetic tradition teaches, we sacrifice and may receive blessing, but the blessing is never guaranteed, never proportional, never under our control. This receptivity shifts the consistency of the social substance itself.

**III. Lines of Flight and the Receptive**

The molecular carries within it a potential for rupture. When pressure builds enough, desire breaks through its prescribed boundaries entirely—what Deleuze and Guattari call a "line of flight." This is not chaos, but creative escape that invents new ground:  the moment someone quits a soul-crushing job without another lined up, the instant a long-held belief dissolves in a single conversation, the decision to forgive what seemed unforgivable.  

These ruptures are immanent to any system, always present as potential. Like a biological mutation, they represent the system's own energy finding a way out of forms that can no longer contain it. The 9-to-5 routine that suddenly becomes unbearable. The marriage that stops making sense. The political certainty that collapses under the weight of a single human encounter.

But we can create conditions that invite these ruptures. The dominant system operates by calculated exchange: "I give to get." Every action expects a return, tracks a metric, calculates a cost. To disrupt this, we need practices that refuse the calculating logic—acts of indirection and receptivity rather than force and control.  Private prayer, avant-garde art, radical hospitality: when these acts escape commodification and routine, they generate what the system calls "waste" but what is actually surplus—connection the system cannot track or capture.

When we engage in these practices, we stop being static nodes in the system (voter, consumer, activist) and become movement itself. We don't attack the hardened status quo; we change the conditions that allow it to remain hard. This is molecular politics in practice.

**The Civil Rights Movement as Molecular Strategy**

History offers a powerful example. Modern protest often operates at the molar level—born of hardened habits like anger and negation, defining itself by what it opposes, tethering its identity to the enemy—though this is not inevitable. This is “impact” politics: visible, oppositional, transactional

The Civil Rights movement worked differently. Activists didn't just demand laws; they underwent weeks of training to undo ingrained reactive habits—the instinct to hit back, to match violence with violence.  Their strategy was to refuse the transactional script entirely: "You hit me, I hit you back."  They reflected upon their intention; when they walked out into the street, they knew might not leave alive.

By training themselves to embody the "Human" rather than the "Attacker," they forced the oppressor to confront a mirror, not a weapon.  Brutality became visible as brutality, stripped of the justification that "they're fighting back."  They changed themselves first, which changed the substrate of the encounter, which changed what became politically possible.

This demonstrates how the same molar form (protest, demonstration, political demand) can function at either the molar or molecular level depending on how it's practiced.

**Three Primary Modes**

Beyond large-scale movements, molecular politics operates through accessible everyday practices. There are three primary modes: prayer, art, gratitude.

Example 1: Prayer as Molecular Politics

Not public performance, but private prayer. Private prayer operates on the molecular level where the system cannot track or neutralize it.

Prayer is a refusal to let the “Other” become an abstraction in your own mind. It preserves their humanity, keeping the possibilities for connection open. When you pray for an enemy, you cannot simultaneously reduce them to a cartoon. The practice changes you—and you are part of the substrate of politics. This shift in consciousness, multiplied across enough individuals, alters the invisible frequencies that shape visible outcomes.

Example 2: Radical Hospitality

Consider communities that shared meals with Muslims during the crisis of national security and fear following 9/11. The result: It is hard to remain defensive while sharing food. The intimacy of a meal dissolves the abstraction back into a person who worries about their family just like I do. This was gratuitous contact, not a policy demand—a molecular intervention in a moment of molar crisis. Like the Civil Rights activists who refused the script of “Attacker,” these communities refused the script of “Defender.”

Example 3: The Artistic Turn

Art creates the conditions for molecular transformation by suspending ordinary time. It breaks the rush of deadlines and election cycles, creating space for something unexpected to emerge. Dadaism used absurdity to short-circuit the “logic” of WWI, proving that when sense leads to death, nonsense can reclaim life. Surrealism connected the unconscious to the political, “out-dreaming” the rigid structures of fascism. The counterculture demonstrated that shifting the feeling of a culture shifts what becomes politically possible.

A Necessary Warning

Molecular work is not without risk. The goal is not to dissolve all structure—pure structurelessness leads to disintegration, not liberation. We seek what Deleuze calls a “controlled deterritorialization,” a line of flight that creates new possibilities rather than mere chaos. 

The fascist impulse also works at the molecular level, using fear and paranoia to contract connection and intensify separation. Our response is not to retreat to molar rigidity, but to work molecularly in the opposite direction—expanding connection, building a reality that includes rather than excludes.

V. Conclusion: The Synthesis

We need both molar and molecular. Organizing, canvassing, passing laws—this is necessary work. But we have specialized in opposition at the expense of connection. We know how to fight; we have forgotten how to transform the ground beneath the fight.

Canvassing is the harvest; prayer is the tilling. Without molecular work to shift consciousness and culture, our molar efforts meet only hardened resistance. The tilling happens in private acts that generate no metrics, no media coverage, no proof of impact.

Do we have the courage to do work that goes unnoticed and may never receive credit for the changes it catalyzes? The subtle rules the dense. Consciousness precedes form.  Without shifts at the invisible level, the visible action merely meets resistance. 

The choice is not between action and inaction, but between two kinds of action: one that meets hardness with hardness, and one that changes the conditions of hardness itself.


# Glossary of Terms

**Molar**
The level of large-scale, visible structures and identities. Molar elements are the fixed, organized forms we use to make sense of reality: political positions, social roles, institutions, laws. Examples: “I am a Democrat,” “this is capitalism,” “that person is my enemy.” Molar politics operates through opposition, argument, and force—trying to reshape hardened positions with hardened positions.

**Molecular**
The level of subtle, fluid processes beneath molar forms. Molecular elements are the flows of desire, feeling, and consciousness that exist before they congeal into fixed identities. This is the realm of vague dissatisfaction, sudden recognition, dreams, and encounters that shift understanding without offering a new position to occupy. Molecular politics works by changing the invisible substrate—consciousness and culture—that shapes what becomes politically possible.

**Line of Flight** (ligne de fuite)
A rupture or creative escape from existing structures. Not chaos or destruction, but the moment when desire breaks through its prescribed boundaries to invent new ground: quitting a soul-crushing job without a plan, a long-held belief dissolving in conversation, choosing to forgive the unforgivable. Lines of flight are always present as potential in any system—the system’s own energy finding a way out of forms that can no longer contain it.

**Stratification**
The process by which fluid molecular elements harden into organized molar forms over time. Like sediment accumulating into rock, countless micro-decisions and encounters gradually build into what feels like fixed identity or unchangeable structure.

**Deterritorialization**
The undoing or loosening of established structures and identities. When something deterritorializes, it breaks free from its assigned place or function and becomes capable of forming new connections. Can be chaotic (complete dissolution) or controlled (purposeful transformation). Molecular politics aims for controlled deterritorialization—creating conditions for change rather than mere destruction.

**Non-transactional**
Actions that refuse the logic of exchange: “I give to get.” Non-transactional acts expect no return, track no metrics, calculate no cost. Examples: private prayer for an enemy, avant-garde art, sharing a meal with no agenda. These acts generate what the system calls “waste” but is actually surplus—connection the system cannot track or capture. They work at the molecular level where transformation becomes possible.

**Substrate**
The underlying foundation or base material. In this essay, the molecular is the substrate of the molar—the fluid processes that form the foundation of hardened structures. Like soil beneath a building, the substrate is what molar forms rest upon and draw from, even as they seem separate from it.

**The Subtle Rules the Dense**
A principle from hermetic philosopher Valentin Tomberg: invisible, subtle forces (consciousness, culture, feeling) ultimately shape visible, dense outcomes (laws, elections, physical structures). To change what has hardened, we must work at the subtle level where it is still becoming.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
