# Modes of Protestantism


**The Tree of Protestantism (Theology)**

Imagine Protestantism as the trunk. It splits into four major historical branches based on beliefs:

1. Lutheran: Follows Martin Luther.  How can I be forgiven if I’m so bad? Don’t worry about it, just trust that Jesus has already died for your sins, and you are forgiven.  Keep art/music/ritual. 

2. Anglican (Episcopalian): The Church of England style.  Keeps the style of Catholicism But theology  of Protestantism.  Big tent.   Robes/Bishops

3. Anabaptist: Ancestors of Baptists, Mennonites, etc.  Each person chooses their baptism and they reject church hierarchy.  Each person has a vote and the church rules itself.  Likely simple. 

4. Reformed (Calvinist): Follows John Calvin. <-- This is where Presbyterians live.  God selects who gets saved.  And we only do what’s in the Bible.   Very likely no art, music, ritual.  

**Spectrum of gonverment (structure)** 

Presbyterians are unique because they invented a structure that sits right in the middle of the other two dominant styles of the time.

• Top-Down (Episcopal): Rule by a single Bishop/Pope (Catholic, Anglican/Episcopal, Methodist).

• Bottom-Up (Congregational): Rule by the vote of every member; the local church is independent (Baptist, Congregationalist).

• The Middle Way (Presbyterian): Rule by Elders.
• It isn't a dictatorship of one Bishop.
• It isn't a pure democracy of the whole crowd.
• It is a representative democracy where elected elders make decisions.


Each church might elect 6-12 elders depending on church size.  This team of elders along with the Pastor form a board called the session to make monthly meetings just for that church.  

The Presbytery (congress) is a regional body to which each church sends a pastor and 2-3 elders.
