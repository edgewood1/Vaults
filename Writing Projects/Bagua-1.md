# Bagua


Bagua

The geometric diagram created by overlapping the Primordial and Later Heaven Bagua resembles the kinds of diagrams found in an astrological birth chart — and these astrological diagrams carry real significance.

In astrology, the **angles** formed between planets (called **aspects**) have specific energetic meanings. For example:
	•	A **180° angle** (opposition) implies **tension or heightened awareness**.
	•	A **120° angle** (trine) represents **flow, ease, and harmony**.

The overall shapes formed — triangles, squares, stars — are often interpreted as **energy circuits**. For instance, an equilateral triangle connecting three planets 120° apart (a **Grand Trine**) suggests a natural, easy flow of energy. These configurations also have connections to **sacred geometry**.

This same logic can be applied to the **angular relationships between the trigrams** of the Bagua. Each trigram moves from one position in the Primordial Bagua to another in the Later Heaven Bagua. These **angular displacements** can be measured and interpreted energetically.

For example:
	•	The trigram **Heaven (**☰**)** might move from 0° in the Primordial arrangement to 135° in the Later Heaven.
	•	That movement spans **135°**, which corresponds to a **sesquisquare** — a type of **tension that prompts transformation**.
	•	Similarly, movements of **45°, 90°, 120°**, etc., can all be interpreted symbolically.

When you connect all eight trigrams between the two arrangements with lines, the resulting **intersecting geometry** forms a unique pattern — a kind of energetic or symbolic mandala.

Traditionally, the Bagua is aligned in specific, meaningful ways based on **directional anchors** (like cardinal directions), especially in **Feng Shui**. However, you can choose different alignments depending on your goal — spiritual, energetic, geometric, or architectural.

🧭 **Feng Shui Compass and Bagua Reconfiguration**

The **Feng Shui compass** (Luopan) is used to:
	•	Determine the **true directional orientation** of a space (e.g., home, room, altar).
	•	Align that space with **cosmic principles** like the **Five Elements**, **Eight Trigrams**, and **Qi flow**.
	•	Many Feng Shui schools already **reorganize the Bagua** for different ends (e.g. by person, purpose, or time cycle).

The Bagua itself can be **space-sensitive or time-sensitive**, depending on the tradition.

🏠 **Using the Compass to Derive a New Bagua**
	1.	**Use the compass** to assess which directions in a space are **present**, **open**, **obstructed**, or **emphasized**.
	2.	**Overlay the Later Heaven Bagua** onto the compass directions — this becomes your **baseline model**.
	3.	Observe where energy seems **missing**, **blocked**, or **overamplified**.
	4.	These distortions **reconfigure the actual Bagua of the space**, creating an **emergent, personalized Bagua**.
	5.	Rather than sticking to the default, draw a **new Bagua wheel** where each trigram is placed in the direction where its energy is most active.
	6.	Use **line overlays** to compare this new Bagua to the traditional one — and study the **geometry of their differences**.

This creates a **custom cosmogram** — a unique energetic fingerprint of the space — which can be used to:
	•	Analyze elemental imbalances,
	•	Guide spatial adjustments,
	•	Reflect on symbolic transformation,
	•	Or meditate on energetic structure and flow.
