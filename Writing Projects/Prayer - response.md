# Prayer - response


## 
**Can you apply the following to yet another revision of the essay:** 

1. **The "Art, Gratitude, Prayer" section feels slightly undercooked.** Can you choose the most appropriate and effective concrete examples for these essays: we can have 1-3 depending - 3 if each is briefly mentioned, for example.  1 if one goes into detail.  **The historical precedents section lists interesting movements but doesn't quite show HOW they succeeded (or failed).** Did the Surrealists actually liquefy state control, or did they just create interesting art? The Situationists are fascinating, but did the dérive change capitalism? I think you could either lean harder into these as *aspirational* models or provide evidence of their political efficacy. —- can you offer guidance about how these points might be injected into the essay? The essay shouldn’t go hard on “these are the ideal examples” but rather “these are historic examples that might provide guidance / inspiration for future action”.  
7. **The essay might benefit from acknowledging its own position.** This is high-theory leftist analysis written for people who can parse Deleuze. That's fine! But there's a tension between critiquing the canvasser's elitism (only talking to likely voters) while writing something that requires significant cultural capital to understand. The revision helps, but the question remains: who is the audience, and how does this escape the very problem it diagnoses? — can you provide guidance for this point as well.  This essay doesn’t not use overly graduate school level material, and personally I’ve never read deleuze, but have read a summary of their idea, so i could just as well have had a high school diploma to have understood a summary of these basic distinctions.  
9. I worry slightly about the potential for this to become an excuse for political quietism. "Don't organize, just pray and make art" could be misread as abandoning material politics. I think you're actually saying something more sophisticated—that BOTH are necessary, and that the molecular work creates the conditions for the molar work to succeed—but it might be worth making that explicit.  — how can we add elements to not fall into this trap?
