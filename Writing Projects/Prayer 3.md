# Prayer 3


A few other points about this essay: 
I also imagine groups going into the woods and doing ceremonies wiht the micropolitical intentions, the purpose to alter the groups way of thinking and feeling about events, but to also bring into it the aid of the natural world.  This might border on the chaos magical.  One big take away from this is that the small matters more and as much as teh large., the micro more than the macro, or as valentine Tomberg has stated consciousness rules over matter.  See quote below.  Our private feelings matter, and achieving equanimity and talking to others about that journey and affirming the role of this work as fruitful not just for the political or economic or cultural realms but also in the domain of our physical bodies and general health and well-being. 

Also, there’s the matter that the original title of this is “the intersection of prayer and politics”.  So the inclusion of art-movements and the focus on them seem to move them in a slightly different direction unless I forget the connection between prayer and art-movements.  But do i have examples of prayer? I guess the praying for our enemies (without telling the world that we are doing so).  Doesn’t Jesus say something about praying in the silence of our closet? 

Tomberg references from Metiations on teh Tarot:

“Tomberg describes a fundamental principle of sacred magic: *the subtle rules the dense* — specifically that **superconsciousness governs consciousness, consciousness governs force, and force governs matter**.”  

“In his exposition on the Empress (Arcanum III), Tomberg explains the symbolism of her sceptre as representing **the power of consciousness over force** and her shield as the power of energy over matter — *the volatile over the gross*

*Below is the essay as I have recently revised - the changes in it are minor, mostly deleting of certain sentences to downplay the metaphors in order to keep the logic more clear.  I don’t want to lose the reader by repeating them too often.  Can you try not to revise these changes unless you are injecting elements into them or deleting aspects of them.  In other words, don’t replace these new sentences with some of the old ones or insert the old ones where they’ve been removed unless they are really needed.  Thanks.*  

*Here’s the current state of the essay:* 


# **The Geology of Politics: From Molar Collisions to Molecular Shifts**
We often feel stuck in a political landscape that resembles immovable tectonic plates. We rely on heavy, oppositional politics to move them—what philosopher Gilles Deleuze called "molar" methods—rather than "molecular" ones that work at a deeper level.
## 
## **The Illusion of Control: The Map and the Territory**
The problem begins with the most visible form of political action: canvassing. The modern canvasser is not merely taking a neighborly stroll; they are executing a highly engineered logic of extraction. They rely on apps like MiniVAN that generate a "Turf"—a curated digital map where half the neighborhood literally does not exist.

Driven by the reality that elections in swing states are often decided by thin margins (sometimes fewer than 50,000 votes), this technology acts as a filter. It forces the canvasser to treat people as data points to be harvested rather than complex beings to be understood.

This work effectively boosts turnout by "waking up the choir"—getting people who already agree with you to actually vote—but it fails at persuasion. It also assumes that if we just pull enough levers and extract enough data, the machine will output democracy.

The reason this lever-pulling fails is that the digital maps are only skimming the surface of a much deeper, harder reality.

The molar means relating to  a mass or bulk.  It refers to properties measured in large quantities.  The molecular refers to small-scale building blocks, minute particles.  Molar politics are large-scale, visible, aggregated (protests, voting blocks, demographic categories).  Molecular politics are small-scale, undelrying, particle-level (individual desires, micro-interactions, the building blocks of political feeling). 
## 
## **Theoretical Framework: The Two Layers**

Think of political reality as having two distinct strata, like geological layers.

**The Upper Layer** is the realm of what has hardened over time. It is static, rigid, and formed by history.  Because it refers to large or mass quantities, we can also refer to it as molar.  

Crucially, this layer contains two distinct elements:

First, there are the **representational elements**—the metrics, the polls, and the digital maps used by the canvasser. These are the "grid" we place over the world to measure potential. They're our attempt to capture reality in numbers and categories.

Second, there are the **sedimentary elements**—the actual political positions and habits of the populace. This is the "Zeitgeist," a heavy, calcified geology composed of the past few years of history. Think of it as the hardened lava of yesterday's feelings.

**The Lower Layer** is the realm of what's still fluid and moving. Because it is composed of tiny movements, we could also refer to it as molecular.  This is the molten flow of the present. It's the undetermined element—the raw, chaotic circulation of desires, fears, and hopes that exist before they cool down and harden into the sedimentary positions of the Upper Layer.

Here's the fundamental disconnect of traditional politics: it tries to shift the Sediment (hardened habits) by pointing at the Representation (maps and facts), completely ignoring the underlying affect, the feelings and desires that formed the upper layers in the first place.
## 
## **The Paradox of Agency**

This geological reality creates a paradox for activists. The canvasser often operates under the belief that they are a free agent of change wielding the truth. But in reality, they are often acting out a script written by the sedimentary layer of the Zeitgeist. Their "oppositional" stance is not a disruption of the system; it is just another layer of sediment, hardened by the spirit of the age.

The tragedy is that the canvasser tries to cure the apathy of the non-voter or the indecision of the swing voter with the passion of the partisan. But because apathy, indecision, and partisanship are all "sedimentary" reactions to the age—calcified responses to the same history—they do not mesh. They clash.  

Instead, we might contemplate a different kind of agency, one that accesses the "Molecular" layer—the molten core where change actually happens.
## 
## **Case Study: Collision vs. Melt**

We see this distinction clearly when we contrast two historical modes of protest.

Modern oppositional protest often functions as the collective version of the canvasser's delusion. It operates on the Molar level—the level of hardened habits,  and their partial representations.   On this level, participants direct energy against a caricature of the enemy, they cannot flow or connect; they can only interact through impact. 

While participating in such activity may provide a temporary internal release (shifting the participants' own sediment), externally it only serves to pack the opposition's sediment tighter through the pressure of the two sides colliding.

Besides contributing to collisions, calcification can also result in inertia, as we see in the cynic or the non-voter.  Whatever the outcome, the physics remain the same: interaction is limited.

In contrast, the non-violent branch of the Civil Rights movement practiced a form of what we might call Radical Non-Transactional Amity—a refusal to play by the usual rules of action and reaction. By refusing the transactional script of history ("you hit me, I hit you back"), they stopped acting like a solid object. They did not become inert; they became fluid.  

Theirs was a "Spiritual Theater" of dignity and shared humanity that bypassed the rigid "Representational" logic of mechanical power and spoke directly to the fluid and transformational "Molecular" undercurrents of the oppressor.  
## 
## **The Artistic Turn**

If the Civil Rights movement showed us that the "Melt" is more powerful than the "Collision," we might explore other forms of fluidity. <u>Even non-violent protest is often tethered to specific utility (laws, rights), but there exists a category of action that has no utility, no price tag, and no enemy: Art, Gratitude, and Prayer.</u>

While organizing, canvassing, or political engagement at the molar level remain necessary, without molecular work to soften the ground, molar efforts just pack the sediment tighter.  In this sense, molecular work preps the soil for the cultivation of molar work.  

Molecular work is potent because it breaks the logic of scarcity entirely. The system assumes we only give if we get something back. But art creates beauty for its own sake; gratitude gives credit without losing status; and prayer surrenders attention to the Invisible without a guaranteed receipt. All three are forms of the Gift, generating a surplus of love and hope that the economic system cannot capture, tax, or process.

Furthermore, the system relies on us keeping our guard up as defended voters or consumers, but these acts demand vulnerability. You cannot pray, thank, or create while holding a weapon or a grudge. Performing them forces you to drop the armor of the culture war, stopping you from being a static "node" on the map and turning you into a fluid "flow" in the network.

They also interrupt the "progress narrative" by suspending time. While the system traps us in the linear rush of deadlines and election cycles, art suspends time, gratitude appreciates the now, and prayer connects the instant to the eternal. The coherent thread here is "gratuitousness"—meaning uncalled for, unwarranted, and free.

**The Miracle of Contact**

Consider what happened after 9/11, when anti-Muslim sentiment was hardening into policy and violence. Some religious communities didn't respond with protest signs or fact-sheets about Islam. Instead, they invited their congregations to share meals with Muslim neighbors, to visit mosques, to pray together—each in their own tradition, side by side.

This wasn't transactional—it didn't demand policy changes or ask for anything in return. It was gratuitous contact that forced vulnerability: you can't break bread with someone while maintaining your defensive crouch. The sharing of food became a kind of art, an aesthetic of hospitality. The explicit acknowledgment of common humanity became gratitude. The parallel prayers became recognition of shared mystery.
The "success" wasn't measurable in votes or policy changes, but in the countless individual moments where the the other’s hardened category of "Muslim" melts back into "a person who worries about their daughter's college applications just like I do." This is molecular work—it doesn't show up on maps or metrics, but it changes the substrate from which political positions emerge. When enough ground softens this way, the seeds planted by traditional organizing can actually take root.

So, praying for the opposition isn't passive; it is the beginning of a new habit that changes the invisible frequency of the culture at the molecular level, so that the political outcome can finally shift at the surface.

## **Historical Precedents: Experiments in Liquefaction**

We see precedents for these methods throughout history, though their political efficacy remains a matter of interpretation. These movements may not have achieved their grandest ambitions, but they succeeded in revealing something crucial about how consciousness can be shifted:

**The Surrealists** sought to drill directly into the unconscious to liquefy the sediment of state control. Salvador Dalí's "paranoid-critical method" involved deliberately cultivating a kind of productive madness—allowing delirious interpretations of reality to access the subconscious. This created multiple, simultaneous images within one figure, appearing as "hand-painted dream photographs" with uncanny realism but irrational meaning. It was a systematic way to induce irrational knowledge by critically interpreting subconscious connections, using optical illusions and juxtapositions to reveal hidden meanings in everyday objects. Whether they actually dismantled fascism is debatable, but they demonstrated that consensus reality is more fragile than it appears—a lesson worth remembering.

**The Situationists** rejected the rigid grid of the city to engage in the "dérive" or "drift"—walking the wrong way, guided only by feeling, to break the invisible control of the urban map. They believed cities were designed to force us into routines; by drifting, they broke the invisible grid of control. Did this topple capitalism? No. But decades later, we see their insight validated: the way we move through space shapes what we think is possible. A Durham map that ignored Duke and the Tobacco Campus to highlight invisible emotional landmarks—the corner where neighbors spontaneously gather, the park where different communities overlap, the tree that marks where a community garden could be—wouldn't change zoning laws tomorrow, but it might change what kinds of futures residents can imagine for their city. And imagination is where the molecular becomes available.

**Dada** used cut-ups and chance operations to scramble the "Representational Layer" of media propaganda. Think of William Burroughs slicing up newspapers and reassembling them randomly, breaking the hypnotic spell of linear narrative that media uses to manufacture consent. By destroying the syntax of power, they revealed how much of our "natural" worldview is actually constructed. The cut-up doesn't argue against propaganda; it demonstrates that meaning itself is unstable, that the authoritative voice of the state is just ink that can be rearranged. This method still lives wherever people remix, meme, and remix culture to break official narratives.

**The Counterculture** refused the rewards of the system entirely, choosing alternative ways of living—communes, off-grid homesteads, intentional communities. This impulse hasn't died; it resurfaces in each generation of young people buying old farms, learning to can vegetables, building tiny houses, trying to extract themselves from the extractive economy. Whether these experiments "succeed" politically is beside the point—they create pockets of different possibility, laboratories where people remember that the current system isn't inevitable. They soften the certainty that "this is just how things are."

Lastly, **Russian Cosmism** viewed the ultimate oppression as death itself, ignoring elections to focus on the scientific-spiritual conquest of death and the cosmos—attempting to resurrect the dead and achieve physical immortality. This might sound absurd until you notice the current tech elite's obsession with longevity research, anti-aging treatments, and Mars colonization. Whether it's Nikolai Fedorov in 1900 or Silicon Valley billionaires today, the impulse is the same: refuse to accept the "natural" limits of human existence as fixed. The danger is when this becomes narcissistic escape (immortality for the few, Mars as a gated community). The possibility is when it expands our sense of what's negotiable—if death isn't fixed, maybe neither is capitalism.

These aren't blueprints to copy wholesale, but experiments that gesture toward a different kind of politics—one that works at the level of perception, desire, and possibility rather than just policy and power.

## **The Warning: Don't Melt Too Fast**

However, we must be careful.  Accessing the molecular layer is not without risk. If we try to dissolve the strata too quickly—if we seek pure, uncontainable flow with no structure at all—we do not get freedom; we get madness or death. The goal of micropolitics is not to blow up the mountain entirely, but to drill a "Line of Flight"—a controlled release of pressure that allows the rigidity of rock to reshape itself into something new without complete destruction.

We see this danger in how the Right has adopted methods of breaking consensus reality—what some call "hyperstition," creating fictions that make themselves real through belief. We cannot fight their spell with dry rationalism or "fact-checking," which is like bringing a ruler to a magic fight.  Fighting it with pure chaos just adds to the destruction.

The distinction lies in the direction of the irrationality. The fascist impulse uses the irrational to contract and separate, creating a paranoid **oppositional** narrative that seals off connection.  The alternative approach is to use the irrational to expand and connect, revealing the hidden links between self and other.

The antidote, then, is not to counter "War is Good" with "No, War is Bad"—that's still playing on the same hardened field. Instead, we generate a counter-reality so interconnected and complex that their simple, paranoid story collapses under the weight of the new connections. We do not debunk their myth; we out-dream it with a reality that includes them in a way they cannot resist.

## **Conclusion: Both Layers, Different Workers**

The molecular and molar must work in concert as a collective ecology, not necessarily within each individual. The body politic needs both types of work, but that doesn't mean each person needs to do both. Some people soften ground, some people plant seeds. This is division of labor, not escapism.

But here's what matters: we already have an abundance of molar work. The canvassers are knocking doors, the organizers are running phone banks, the protesters are filling streets. What we lack—desperately—is molecular work. We lack people willing to pray for their enemies, to create beauty without agenda, to practice gratitude across political lines, to soften their own hearts first.

If anything, those already engaged in oppositional, molar strategies should ask themselves: am I also doing the molecular work? Am I softening ground, or just packing sediment tighter? The canvasser who spends their evenings in righteous anger on social media is undermining their own daytime work. The organizer who cannot sit in genuine presence with a neighbor who disagrees is treating symptoms while worsening the disease.

The quiet work of prayer, art, and gratitude is not a retreat from politics—it is the preparation of the field that makes politics possible. You don't need to organize a prayer circle or join a protest march. You need to do the work that softens the substrate: the molecular, non-oppositional approach that changes the invisible frequency of culture.

When you pray for someone you oppose, you are not being passive—you are refusing to let them calcify in your imagination into a caricature. When you create art with no political message, you are generating surplus beauty that the transactional system cannot capture. When you practice gratitude for the good in people you disagree with, you are melting the categories that keep us all frozen in place.

This is not about abandoning political power. This is about recognizing that political power flows through substrate, and right now our substrate is concrete. The question is not whether we can move the immovable plates of politics, but whether we're willing to work at the level where they're still molten. The question is whether we have the courage to do the work that doesn't show up on maps, that can't be checked off a list, that produces no immediate result—the work of becoming fluid ourselves so that others might flow through the cracks we create.
