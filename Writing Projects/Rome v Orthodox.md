# Rome v Orthodox


The Schism: 1054AD
The Main issue was around who ran the church
The Spark: The Filioque, which is the Latin clause “and the son”
The Question: where does the Holy Spirit come from? 
Orthodox: From the father alone - The father is the apex of the triangle from which is begotten the son and from which proceeds the spirits.  The risk is the father seems the king over the son/spirit.  The son does not filter or help create the spirit.  

West: Father and son are a single principle, a combined source of the spirit.  They are the two hands that pour into one cup.  this creates two sources of divinity.  It confuses the nature of god. Implies father and son can produce a divine person, but spirit cannot.  Makes the spirit seem lesser a grandchild of the father.  

The original Nicene Creed (381 AD) was written and agreed upon by an Ecumenical Council (gathering of all bishops East and West).  If the creed belongs to teh whole church, no single bishop has the right to change it.  


In the West, the Pope was seen as the supreme head.  He had universal jurisidiction over all Christians.   The Pope Decides doctrine unilaterally.  

in the East First Among Equals.  The pope is a Senior bishop, but no power to command others.   Decisions must be made by a council of all bishops.  

The spark, the pope acted illegally by changing the Creed without a council, and the East refused to obey this.  

Why one makes sense. 

Is it that the Holy Spirit did arrive as a consequence of the son’s arrival / departure.  

Why did the west do this? 

The addition wasn't an act of aggression against the East; it was a desperate defensive move against a heresy called Arianism.
Here is the concise breakdown of why the West felt they had to add "and the Son."
1. The Threat: Arianism
In the 6th century, Spain (and later France) was overrun by Germanic tribes (like the Visigoths) who were Arian Christians.
 * The Arian Belief: They taught that Jesus was "special," but not fully God. They believed the Father created Jesus, making Jesus lesser than the Father.
 * The Problem: The Western Church needed a way to slam the door on this idea and prove that Jesus = God in every conceivable way.
2. The Logic: "The Equality Proof"
The Western bishops (starting at the Council of Toledo in 589 AD) used the Filioque as a theological weapon to upgrade the status of the Son.
Their logic went like this:
 * Premise 1: The Father is fully God.
 * Premise 2: If the Father has a divine power that the Son lacks, then the Son is lesser than the Father.
 * The Conflict: If the Father can "breathe out" the Holy Spirit, but the Son cannot, then the Father has a "superpower" that Jesus doesn't have. This leaves the door open for Arians to say, "See? Jesus isn't equal."
 * The Fix: By adding "and the Son," they ensured the Son shared in the Father's defining ability to produce the Spirit. It effectively said: "Anything the Father has, the Son has too (except being the Father)."
3. The "Biblical" Justification
The West also looked at the Bible, specifically passages where Jesus says, "I will send the Helper [Spirit] to you" (John 15:26).
 * The Western thought process: "If Jesus sends the Spirit to us on Earth, it must be because the Spirit flows from Him in Heaven. God's actions on Earth (economics) must match His eternal reality."
 * The Eastern Rebuttal: "Sending a messenger doesn't mean you gave birth to the messenger."
Summary
The West broke the "Upright Pyramid" because they were terrified that if they didn't, people would stop believing Jesus was fully God. They sacrificed the structure of the Trinity (the Monarchy of the Father) to save the status of the Son (Equality).



The East couldn't see the "danger" of Arianism because, for them, that war was already over. They had won it centuries earlier, and they had used a completely different set of theological weapons to do it.
To the Orthodox, the West was acting like a soldier showing up to a battlefield 200 years after the war ended, firing a cannon that accidentally blew up the winner's own fortress.
Here is why the East felt the West’s "fix" was unnecessary and dangerous.
1. Different Wars, Different Weapons
The West was fighting Germanic barbarians (Visigoths/Franks) in the 6th–9th centuries who thought Jesus was a "lesser god."
 * The West's Solution: "Glue" Jesus to the Father so tightly that you can't tell them apart. If the Father breathes out the Spirit, Jesus must do it too.
 * The East's Reality: They had defeated Arianism back in the 300s (Council of Nicaea & Constantinople).
 * The East's Solution: They defeated Arianism not by merging the Father and Son, but by emphasizing that all three Persons share the exact same Essence (Nature), even if their roles (origins) are different. They didn't need the Filioque to prove Jesus was God.
2. The "Double-Headed Monster" (The Eastern Fear)
You asked why they couldn't see the danger. It’s because they saw a worse danger in what the West was doing.
To the Orthodox, if you say the Spirit comes from "Father-and-Son," you are merging two persons into one lump.
 * The Fear: If the Father and Son act together as one source, you are blurring the distinction between them.
 * The Heresy: This looked like Sabellianism (Modalism)—the ancient heresy that says the Father and Son are just different "masks" for the same guy. The East thought the West was accidentally turning the Trinity into a "Binity" (a two-person God).
3. The "Lost in Translation" Problem
This is the hidden culprit. They were literally speaking different languages that made the theology sound different.
 * Latin (Procedere): The West used the word procedere for the Spirit's movement. This word is vague—it just means "to flow forth" or "move forward." It can mean "to originate" OR "to be sent." So, saying "The Spirit flows from the Son" sounds fine in Latin.
 * Greek (Ekporeusis): The East used the word ekporeusis. This is a very specific, technical word that means "to originate from a primal source." It implies the ultimate starting point.
 * The Clash: When the East heard the West say the Spirit "proceeds" from the Son, they translated it as ekporeusis. This sounded insane to them. It sounded like the West was saying the Son is the Ultimate Creator of the Spirit, which destroys the Father's role.
4. Cultural Snobbery
We cannot ignore the human element. The Byzantine Greeks looked down on the Western "Franks" (Charlemagne's people) as uneducated barbarians.
 * The Attitude: "We wrote the New Testament. We hosted the Ecumenical Councils. We speak the language of the Apostles. Who are these semi-literate tribes in the dark forests of Germany to tell us how to define the Trinity?"
Summary
The East didn't see the danger because they didn't have an Arian problem anymore. Instead, they looked at the West's "fix" and saw:
 * Bad Theology: It blurred the Father and Son (Sabellianism).
 * Bad Language: It claimed the Son was an "Ultimate Source" (due to translation errors).
 * Bad Manners: It was "barbarians" rewriting the ancient Creed without permission.


This is a surprisingly common dilemma for Catholics who study Church history. The good news is that the Roman Catholic Church has significantly softened its stance on this in recent decades, acknowledging that the Orthodox view is not a heresy, but a "complementary" perspective.
Here is a practical guide on how to navigate this as a faithful Catholic who sides with the East on this point.
1. In Public Mass: "When in Rome..."
When you are attending a Roman Rite Mass, the primary goal is communal unity. The Creed is a public declaration of the gathered community's faith.
 * The Recommendation: Out of respect for the community and the rite, you should generally follow the local liturgy.
 * The "Soft" Protest: If your conscience bothers you, you are permitted to simply remain silent during the phrase "and the Son." You do not need to announce it or make a scene; just pause while the congregation says it. This is a respectful way to maintain your theological integrity without disrupting the unity of the liturgy.
2. The Theological "Hack": Mental Reframing
The Catholic Church actually accepts the Orthodox formulation as valid if understood correctly. The Council of Florence and modern catechisms admit that "From the Father through the Son" is a perfectly orthodox way to express the relationship.
 * What to do: When you recite "and the Son" (Filioque), you can mentally intend the meaning "through the Son" (per Filium).
 * Why this works: Even the Orthodox agree the Spirit comes through the Son temporally (sent to us). By framing it this way in your mind, you are affirming the Monarchy of the Father (that the flow starts with Him) while acknowledging the Son's role in the transmission.
3. Private Prayer: Go Original
In your own private rosary or devotional prayers, you are entirely free to recite the Creed in its original 381 AD form (without the Filioque).
 * Why: The Roman Church acknowledges that the original Greek text is the "normative" text. In fact, when Popes celebrate Mass with Eastern Patriarchs today, they often recite the Creed in Greek without the Filioque to show unity. You are on safe ground doing this privately.
4. The "Eastern Catholic" Option
If this resonates deeply with you, you might find a spiritual home (or just a refreshing visit) in an Eastern Catholic Church (like the Byzantine Catholic or Melkite Catholic Church).
 * The Context: These are churches that are fully Catholic (under the Pope) but use the Orthodox liturgy.
 * The Creed: Most Eastern Catholic churches recite the Creed without the Filioque.
 * The Benefit: You can remain in full communion with Rome while praying the Creed exactly as the Orthodox do.
Summary
You are not a heretic for agreeing with the East on this. The Vatican’s official position today is that the Filioque was a specific clarification for the Latin West, not a correction of the East.
My suggestion: In public Mass, simply stay silent for those three words. In private, pray the original.
