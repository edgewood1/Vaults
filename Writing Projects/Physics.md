# Physics


When exposed to light, a metal will emit electrons. This is the photoelectric effect. 
* electrons absorb light’s energy
* They break free of their nuclear orbits.
* Only happens for certain frequencies of light.
* red light has not affect because it delivers large amounts of lower energy photons.   It doesn’t have enough energy to eject electrons


Wave-particle duality
* waves can behave like particles
