# Dead house gates


# **The Ancient Conflict (Imass vs. Jaghut)**
Think of the conflict as a classic good-versus-evil genocide scenario:

| Group                                                                     | Key Trait                                                                 | Goal/Role                                                                 | Memory Aid                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Imass                                                                     | Mortal, tribal, numerous                                                  | Victims turned undead hunters                                             | Immortal Imass Inhumans: They want to Irradicate the Jaghut.              |
| Jaghut                                                                    | Powerful, ice magic, sparse                                               | Oppressors/Tyrants                                                        | Jagged Jaghut: They are the Jerks who Justify the genocide.               |
| The Ritual                                                                | The magical transformation                                                | Undead permanence (T'lan Imass)                                           | The Ritual made them Runners who Refuse to die until their hunt is Ready. |

**Summary Sentence:** The **Imass** were tormented by the **Jaghut** Tyrants, so they did the **Ritual** to become the eternal, undead **T'lan Imass** dedicated to total genocide.



# **The Modern Duo (Mappo + Icarium)**
The relationship here is based on secrets and protection:

| Character                                                              | Species                                                                | Key Traits                                                             | Memory Aid                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mappo                                                                  | Trell (Imass relative)                                                 | Loyal protector, bears the secret                                      | Mappo the Monitor: He Makes sure Icarium doesn't Melt down.            |
| Icarium                                                                | Half-Jaghut                                                            | Amnesiac powerhouse, destructive                                       | Icarium the Insane: He doesn't remember all the people he has Injured. |

**Summary Sentence:** **Mappo** (the protector) is related to the **Imass**, and he’s constantly traveling with **Icarium** (the Jaghut relative) who has memory loss, hiding the fact that Icarium is a world-ending monster.

# **Overall Connections**
A single visual trick can tie it all together:
* **Mappo** and the ancient **Imass** are **relatives** (Trells and Imass share ancestry).
* **Icarium** and the ancient **Jaghut** are **relatives** (he is half-Jaghut).
* Mappo spends his life 
* *protecting* his Jaghut friend (Icarium) from the truth, even though Mappo's own ancestor race (Imass) vowed to *destroy* the Jaghut race. This irony is key to their story.

The convergence to the Azath Housse Temorlor along the Path of Hands is believed to offer ascnednecy. 

Azath House
- an entity 
- manifests as a physical structure and acts as a neutral force for maintaining cosmic balance. 
- It is a prison for Ascendants, gods, and other beings of immense power that threaten the world. 
- When raw unchained power runs wild, an Azath house appears to contain it.  
- It is also a hub for travel between different warrens and worlds.  
- Each house is protected by a guardian.  
- One house is called Tremorlor - the house of life in the holy desert of raraku.  

Ascendancy.  


Path of hands
- a prpophescy promising a chance at ascendancy (godhood) and opportunity for one among them to become supreme ruler.  

convergence
- A scheme by the gods of shadow.  They laid a false trail to the Azath house.  To lure the most powerful soletaken and divers within Azath house, thus neutralizing them. 
- Done by manipulating a visceral yearning of theirs.  
- The prophecy was already a legend among


The actual path of hands - goes to the beast throne.  In post’s tempempel.  

If shapeshifter sensed this path opening up, how did it? The path of hands was more than just a series of milestone markers? Was it a magical path that drew the shapeshifter, using the pull of the Azath house? 

Actually the path of hands is jsut a physical trail of handprints, but its drawing power was connected to the pull of the Azath house itself.  

So the true gate was in pust’s temple, and the true path of hands too, and this drew teh shapeshifters to the general area, but a false path was made, which was found, and followed.  Because this path also led to a house, the shaeshifters thought they were on the right path.  

Here is a breakdown of the sequence of events, confirming your understanding:
1. **The True Location**: The actual gate of the "Path of Hands" (which led to the realm of the Beast Throne and the potential for ascendancy) was indeed hidden in the catacombs beneath Iskaral Pust's temple in the Holy Desert of Raraku.
3. **The Initial Convergence**: The inherent, instinctual drive and the powerful magical aura of the true gate drew all the ambitious Soletaken and D'ivers to the general area of Pust's temple.
5. **The False Path Creation**: Shadowthrone and Pust created a separate, painted trail of hand symbols leading away from the temple and towards the Azath House Tremorlor.
7. **The Deception**: The shapeshifters, blinded by ambition, rage, and the powerful magical signature of the nearby Azath House, found the false, physical path. The Azath House's powerful aura made the false path feel like the correct one, leading to a place of immense power.
9. **The Result**: They followed the false path right into the Azath House, which then contained or destroyed them as it is designed to do with immense, wild power
