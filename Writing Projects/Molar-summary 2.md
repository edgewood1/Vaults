# Molar/summary 2


This is a great set of questions that touches on the practical application of Deleuze and Guattari's (D&G) concepts.
Here is a breakdown of Molar and Molecular forces in society, followed by an explanation of the "Lines" that connect and separate them.
1. Examples of Molar and Molecular Forces in Society
The Molar is the domain of statistics, established categories, and large aggregates. It is how society counts, governs, and stabilizes itself.
The Molecular is the domain of flows, distinct nuances, and shifting desires that happen between or beneath those categories.
Here are concrete examples comparing the two:
A. The Workforce and Economics
 * Molar Force (The Corporation & Unions): This is the organized labor market. It relies on fixed contracts, job titles, and collective bargaining. It is quantifiable and rigid.
   * Statistic: In 2023, union members accounted for 10.0% of wage and salary workers in the United States (approx. 14.4 million people). This is a molar aggregate—a clearly defined block of political and economic power.
 * Molecular Force (The Gig Economy & "Hustle Culture"): This is the flow of labor that escapes traditional categorization. It is characterized by instability, flexibility, and a lack of clear boundaries between "work" and "life."
   * Statistic: A 2023 survey by Upwork found that 64 million Americans (38% of the workforce) performed freelance work. This represents a molecular flow where individuals detach from the "molar" corporate identity to become fluid agents, though this flow is constantly being "recaptured" (molarized) by apps like Uber or Doordash that impose new rigid structures.
B. Identity and Demographics
 * Molar Force (The Census): The government requires stable identities to govern. The US Census is a quintessential molar machine; it forces complex human lives into boxes (Race, Sex, Income Bracket) to create actionable data for the State.
   * Statistic: The 2020 US Census recorded that 19.1% of the population is Hispanic or Latino. This is a "molar segment"—a fixed block used for allocating resources and political representation.
 * Molecular Force (Fluid Identity): This is the personal, shifting experience of identity that resists binary classification. It operates on the level of "becoming" rather than "being."
   * Statistic: A 2024 PRRI survey found that 28% of Gen Z identify as LGBTQ+, compared to much lower numbers in older generations. The molecular aspect here is not just the number, but the proliferation of micro-categories (non-binary, genderfluid, pansexual) that dismantle the rigid male/female molar binary.
2. Lines of Segmentation
Deleuze and Guattari describe society not as a single block, but as something cut by different types of lines. These "lines of segmentation" explain how we move between the Molar and the Molecular.
There are two main types of segmentation:
A. Rigid Segmentation (The Molar Line)
These are lines that clearly cut and define our lives. They are binary, linear, and distinct.
 * Examples:
   * Time: School \rightarrow Work \rightarrow Retirement.
   * Space: The bedroom \rightarrow The office \rightarrow The church.
   * Social: Man vs. Woman, Adult vs. Child, Teacher vs. Student.
 * Function: They create distinct "segments" that we pass through. You know exactly when you cross the line (e.g., punching a time clock).
B. Supple Segmentation (The Molecular Line)
These lines are more fluid and difficult to pinpoint. They are the "micro-politics" of life.
 * Examples:
   * The subtle shift in atmosphere at a party before a fight breaks out.
   * The gradual drifting apart of friends (there is no single "break up" moment, just a flow of detachment).
   * A "mid-life crisis" where you are still technically in the "Adult/Worker" segment, but internally, everything is in flux.
 * Function: These flows coexist with rigid lines but operate on a different rhythm. You can be rigidly segmented as a "successful banker" (Molar) while simultaneously experiencing a molecular flow of panic or desire that contradicts that identity.
3. Lines of Flight
The Line of Flight (or ligne de fuite) is the third and most radical type of line. It is neither rigid nor supple; it is a rupture.
What is it?
A line of flight is a force of deterritorialization. It is when a system, person, or group breaks away from the Molar aggregates and the Molecular flows to create something entirely new. It is not just fleeing (running away); it is "fleeing while causing things to flee"—a creative escape.
Key Characteristics:
 * Mutation: It does not return to the status quo. It changes the nature of the organism or society.
 * Risk: Lines of flight are dangerous. If uncontrolled, they can lead to destruction (madness, suicide, fascism). If successful, they lead to revolution or artistic creation.
Concrete Example:
 * The Molar: A person is trapped in a 9-5 job (Rigid Segment) and a traditional marriage (Rigid Segment).  Molar lines are binary, fixed.
 * The Molecular: They start feeling a vague dissatisfaction and start reading radical philosophy or daydreaming (Supple Segment). Molecular lines are supple and reflect shifting tension and vague feelings.
 * The Line of Flight: They quit their job, sell their house, and move to a commune to invent a new way of living. This act breaks the molar segments and creates a "new earth."lines of flights are ruptures, transformation, a revolt.  Is it a birth?
Summary Table of the Three Lines:
| Type of Line | Characteristic | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Rigid Line (Molar) | Binary, segmentary, fixed | The 9-to-5 workday; The border between nations. |
| Supple Line (Molecular) | Fluid, micro-political, obscure | The shifting tension in a room; A vague feeling of unease. |
| Line of Flight | Rupture, transformative, abstract | A revolution; An avant-garde artistic movement; A psychotic break. |
A Note on Interaction
Deleuze and Guattari emphasize that we live on all three lines simultaneously.
 * We have our Molar identity (Passport, Tax ID).
 * We navigate Molecular negotiations (office politics, ambiguous relationships).
 * We occasionally find Lines of Flight (moments of creative breakthrough or radical change).
Would you like to explore how "Lines of Flight" can sometimes turn into something dangerous, like what D&G call a "micro-fascism"?
