# Pneuma


Two principles
Matter - passive
Logos - divine reason / active + moving

Logos is carried by pneuma.

Nous - capacity for inituitive insight - noetic
Logos - capacity of combination / discursive thinking - logical
Pneuma is the precondition for nous/logos (soul)
In matter, it holds a thing together (unity / substance) and keeps it apart (quality / quantity) thus keeping things stable and coherent. 

Two parts of the soul
Pneuma 
- inferior
- desires / aversions affect this part; spirit; breath; 
- Motion / warmth
- Active / generative principle that organizes individual.  
- Pre-condition for soul. 
- structures matter, so it exists in inanimate objects - thus it is form.
-  
Nous - superior (mind) // highest form 

Three kinds of pneuma depending on proportion of fire / air

1. tonos: state / tension - pneuma as providing stability or cohesion (*[hexis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexis)*) to things;  
- Moving outwardly: produces [quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity#Background) and [quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy))Moving inwardly: provides unity and substance.
- Pneuma holds a thing together and separates it from the world.   
4. **The pneuma as life force.** The vegetative pneuma enables growth (*[physis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physis)*) 
8. **The pneuma as soul.** rarefied and fiery, governing movements, and endowing it with powers of perception and reproduction. 
10. **Pneuma as rational soul** (*logica psychê*) of the mature human being, which grants the power of judgment.

Pneuma is the vehicle of logos in structuring matter in all things.  
Logos is the constructive fire that drives cyclical generation and destruction.  

An analogy for the Holy Spirit

Pneuma - breath / sustaining consciousness / chi / mediates between heart and brain; Greek testament, it means spirit
Air - are
Soul - psyche

Nous in Hylomorphism 
Active intellect

Passive - receives the intelligible forms of things
Active - makes the potential knowledge into actual
Intelligible form - form that can be apprehended by intellect. - genera / species.  Form makes knowledge possible.  

Form is what allows things to be intelligible, to be defined, change.  

Pneuma penetrates and underlies all things, it is associated with life-energy.  Fire.  Not mind or soul, but soul-like.  The vital heat, the condition / principle of soul.  Penetrates and informs all things.  It makes matter enamored to form.  Creative fire.  Divinity.  Creative life energy.
