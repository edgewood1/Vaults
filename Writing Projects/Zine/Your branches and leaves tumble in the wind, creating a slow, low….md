# Your branches and leaves tumble in the wind, creating a slow, low…

Your branches and leaves tumble in the wind, creating a slow, low roar like the continuous crashing of waves against the shore.

When the wind ceases, you return to stillness and silence, your natural state of being.

The movement of the branches requires a cause, a directed force.  Stillness, however, only requires the absence of that cause.   

This is also true for me.  My thoughts and desires are immaterial causes.  Just as the wind compels your branches, some unconscious thought, some desire for insight, compels these senses to turn to you, to seek what you might be and represent: a kind of goodness, beauty, or truth.

**Contingent Acts**

You are what appears, but you are also bound up with other possibilities, possibilities that depend entirely on the world that accompanies you.  

This dependency places a limit on your life: your movements are only as powerful as the wind or as flexible as your branches.  We are only as good as the things that influence us. 

This limitation implies lack:  you could always move with more or less intensity, with more ore less grace.  

You could always be greater or worse, but you can never be fully what you could be.  You will never be quite enough.  You are forever becoming and, by your very nature, forever incomplete.  

Forever imperfect. 

However, this isn’t a moral failing; this is the natural state of things.  

Your imperfections are a sign of your being and your becoming - of your ability to live, grow, and change.  You are imperfect so that you can continuously become.  

Unlike your movements, a perfect one would be an end in itself - unchanging, complete, and uncaused.  Such movement is not possible in our physical world.  

It can only exist in the immaterial world, as a pure, eternal, unchanging act, always already complete…

**Substantial and accidental change.** 

Whether you move or are still, you remain a tree.  But were you to decompose into earth, you would cease to be a tree. 

Purpose combines the dream of a goal with the desire to achieve it.   It is an intangible thing, yet it drives so many tangible and intangible acts. 

Our purpose is to grow into mature beings; the purpose of a rock is to remain still and silent.  

In doing these,  we express the power and perfection of that which sustains us.  

These are non-deliberate examples.  They require no decision.  They simply occur.  Deliberate ones, like those of my will are different.   

**Essence v Nature**

Your essence defines what you are.  Just as my essence is to be a rational animal, your essence, a tree, prevents you from ever being anything else.  

Within the boundaries of your essence, your nature is the active principle that directs what you can do - to grow, bear fruit, and reproduce. 

**Purpose and Incidental Effects.**

This is true for all of creation.  

Each thing’s purpose is to fulfill its own nature.  The wind’s purpose is to move areas of high pressure to low pressure while the purpose of your branches is to hold leaves to absorb sunlight.  

Each seeks to fulfill their own nature, yet their silent purposes collide.  The wind’s moving of your branches is an incidental side effect, a physical change that is neither the primary purpose of the wind nor the purpose of the branches.  The movement of your branches is an effect of the wind fulfilling its nature.   

This essence implies potentials.  Just as a ball’s essence gives it the potential to bounce when it is dropped, a ting’s existence  implies potentials that can be actualized by external factors.  A thing’s actions are a reflection of its nature, but not all actions are part of a deliberate, shared purpose.   

**Efficient cause & Non-contingency**

A tree’s life depends on temporal causes like rain.  The tree is hydrated because the rain enters the soil; the rain enters soil because the soil is sufficiently porous & the rain sufficiently heavy; the rain falls because certain atmospheric conditions unfold…  

However, a tree cannot sustain its existence on temporal causes alone.  In order to have these attributes, a tree must first exist, and what sustains our existence? What higher-order cause? (Non-contingent)

**Nature of non-contingent**

The attributes of the higher cause are the opposite of a contingent act.  

There can only be one non-contingent act. If there were more than one, a distinction between them would imply that one lacks something the other has. This would introduce a limitation, yet a non-contingent act is, by definition, limitless.

This lack of limitation also means it has no parts; it is perfectly unified. In this framework, all purely immaterial beings, like the human soul, are also without parts.

It is fully realized and has no potential. Because it has no potential, it is incapable of change, and it is perfect. 

Being fully realized, it is the <u>**source**</u> that enables all contingent acts, which are a blend of act and potential.

It is transcendent; it exists outside the temporal causal chain. It is ever-present and sustains everything in existence simultaneously. As the <u>**source**</u> of all being and perfection, it is the means by which all other things can be realized.

**Non-Contingent Act as Cause and Purpose**

The non-contingent act is both the efficient cause and the final cause of all things.

Purpose is the meaning behind an act, or its end goal. For the non-contingent act, its purpose is simply to be and to sustain being. There is no other motive or agenda. As the ultimate purpose of all created things, the non-contingent act's meaning is found in its own perfection, which all things strive to reflect.

The non-contingent act is the Primary Efficient Cause of all things because it grants existence, enabling all other contingent acts. Its will to create is its own purpose. Unlike a human's will, which can be a means to a larger end, there is no end outside of the non-contingent act itself. Its will to create is both the ultimate cause of all things and their ultimate purpose.

Glossary

*Final cause: the purpose of  a thing.  this is always immaterial 
Efficient cause: the agent that acts.  This can be immaterial (a thought compels us) or material (the wind tussling our hair).   This is what we typically associate with cause. 
Essence: that which defines a substance; prevents it from being anything but a tree.
Will: the agent that acts to achieve the goal
Nature: within the limits of essence, this is the principle that guides to action.*

**Summary of first section**

Potential depends on external act.  Dependency means we are only as good as our causes.  This limits us.  This means we will never be perfect  but imperfection is a sign of our being and becoming - our living, growing, changing

Appendix: **Both**

If my desire to look at you coincides with my will to look at you, then the final and efficient cause are the same. 

But if my desire is to find beauty, so I will myself to look at you in hopes of finding it, then they differ. the desire to find beauty is the ultimate purpose (final cause), and the will to look at you becomes the means to an end (efficient cause).
