# Percept


I see the tree with a friend. 

She and I see different aspects: I notice the branch’s movement & she squirrel nest. 

Or is this meant: 

We both notice the branche’s movements - but notice different aspects of this movements, partly due to the angle, but also the quality of our sensory organs, and the associations made. 

Image/Associations
1. Image - sensory organ alone? Imagination is the ability of constructing an image. 

To imagine = to represent
This act creates two sets: the actual and the possible; counter-factuals; Other than the present or other than one’s own.  

Imagination is a faculty th at produces images.  To imagine is to hold a mental image, or an impression of a perception.  

Our imagination transform the sensory data into images.  Since for each of us, the sensory data is largely the same, we will create largely the sam e imagines, but there will be variations.  The image formation involved in perception is large-ley pre-conscious and influenced by our evolutionary history, designed to quickly recognize basic patterns, threats, and potential resources.  Social norms intrude.  

God is a mind, and some say that this mind expresses itself through either creative acts or conceptual frameworks.  Either way, it suggests a consciousness and purposeful force behind the universe.
