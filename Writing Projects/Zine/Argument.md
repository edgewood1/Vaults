# Argument


Essence 
- the defining characteristics or nature of a thing. 

existence
- refers to the act of being or actuality. 

Essence can be contingent or necessary

Contingent being
- It once did not exist
- Possible that it didn’t exist now
- undergoes change (potential > actual) thus dependent, ultimately to a necessary being
- Dependent on others
- Limited
- Essence not existence 
- Physical world
- What happens to exist but end not have existed.  

Necessary being 
- has always existed and always will.
- permanent; no change
- Self-sustained; self-sufficient; self-existent
- Not-limited
- Essence = existence

Chain of causality 
- infinite: has no first cause (impossible, since without a first cause, there would be not others)
- Finite: has a first cause (a necessary being)

Things in the physical cosmos
- contingent because they change.

Two objects of participation
- qualities 
- Existence 

An essence can consist of 
- Subject + various degrees of various qualities / such essences can undergo change.
- Existence / does not undergo change.  (What about Truth, Love, Justice? These are also transcendental. Existence is all these things.

Args 1
- if we were existence:
- we would exist by necessity (not be contingent), but we do change
- We would be immortal / unlimited, but we’re not
- I would be existence and not me.

Args2
- I can’t have existence as an attribute butecause it’s not one; it’s not one. Quality among many, but that which governs whether a quality is present / existent.
- It is an act / state of being - it informs substance not qualities

Arg3
- Contingent being depends on non-congitent, ultimate, for being. 
Arg4

- If no first cause, no current result, but that’s not true.  


Sun

- We benefit from the sun when it shines on us, we participate in sunlight.  Sustained by its power. 
- We are not th e sun
- We are not its rays
- The sun is not one of our attributes
- We merely participate in its action- 
- If we derive our ability to see from the sun, but we can use tech to reproduce these effects: infrared goggles.
- Can we reproduce the effects of being? Sexual book. 

**Three suns**

- different stages or levels of spiritual and alchemical transformation.

1. The Black Sun: associated with darkness, dissolution, and the prima materia, which is the starting material or substance that undergoes transformation. The Black Sun represents the unconscious, the shadow aspects, and the process of purification and dissolution of impurities.   (Etheric?)

2. The White Sun: the purification and refinement of the prima materia, leading to the emergence of a more refined and spiritual state. The White Sun is associated with the lunar qualities, such as reflection, receptivity, and the integration of opposites. It represents the synthesis and harmonization of opposing elements within the alchemist.

3. The Gold or Red Sun:  associated with the attainment of the Philosopher's Stone.  highest spiritual realization. The radiant, divine light, and the ultimate perfection and enlightenment achieved through the alchemical process.

Notes
- (Essence = substance/subject(changeless) + attributes(change)).
- Two types of things that can have existence - conceptual and actual existence. Unicorns exist conceptually - cna be described as an idea, but not found as a living creature. 


qualities associated with God's existence 

1. Necessary Existence:
 
3. And Self-Causing Existence: Aquinas argues that God is the cause of His own existence. Unlike contingent beings, whose existence is caused by something external, God's existence is self-caused. He is the uncaused cause, the source of all being.

4. And complete.  Pure Actuality: Aquinas posits that God is pure actuality, devoid of any potentiality or imperfection. God's existence is complete and lacking in nothing. He possesses all perfections to the fullest extent.

5. Tus not limited.  Infinite Existence: God's existence transcends limitations of time, space, and quantity. He is not bound by any boundaries or constraints, being infinite in nature.

6. If complete then Unchanging Existence: Aquinas argues that God's existence is immutable and unchangeable. God does not undergo any alteration or transformation, as His existence is eternal and timeless.

5 ways 

1. The Argument from Motion: Aquinas argues that since everything in the world is in motion, there must be a prime mover who initiated this motion. This prime mover, he identifies as God, who is not in motion but rather the source of all motion.
2. The Argument from Efficient Causes: Aquinas suggests that everything in the world has a cause, and there cannot be an infinite regress of causes. Therefore, there must be an uncaused first cause, which is God.
3. The Argument from Possibility and Necessity: Aquinas states that things in the world can either exist or not exist, and since it is possible for them to not exist, there must have been a time when nothing existed. However, if there was ever nothing, nothing would exist now, which is contradictory. Thus, there must be a necessary being whose existence is not contingent on anything else, and that being is God.


## It would have these traits: 

* It would be unconfined to a specific form or instance & would be a reference for the totality of all that exists.  Being unlimited, it would be eternal / unchanging.
* It would be necessary - everything would depend on it in order to actualize identity. 
* It would be the common ground for the multiplicity of the world.
* It is pure being itself, without a hint of potentiality - pure act vs conceptual or hypothetical being.

3) goodness - desired by all 
1) Simple- lacks parts - and unified (all things are one) 
2) perfection: complete (lacks nothing) / and thus immutable. (non-contingent) 4) unlimited ~ everywhere, everytime (eternity)  


## Reality is continually sustained the way it is. 

## - existence is **t**he fundamental act of being itself 
- Existence isn’t a quality that can be seperates from a person’s essence.  
- existence is not something added to an individual's essence; existence is not seen as an attribute possessed by individuals 


## - The actualization of existence is a fundamental act of being itself.   That’s what being does - actualize existence.
- 
- existence is the actuality of those characteristics
- existence is necessary for anything to have properties or attributes, including individuals.
- Existence is the foundational reality upon which attributes and properties are predicated.

## Prime Mover (Efficient Cause)
* the artist, an object, beyond time
* Outside evolution, or the “process”
* Not seperate from / working as a natural process
* Ground of being; creative energy unfolding in all
* Difference between presence and god? 
* Summit and source of urge towards complexity

## Future State (Final Cause) / Omega Point
* transcendental state of love
* We are being shaped towards this end. 
* Relation to logos? 
* Final cause / purpose
* Coincides with god’s presence. 
* Do angels and people merge with OP or is OP merece to joint the spirit hierarchy

## Interiority (Efficient Cause2)
* over time, objects move to greater complexity/coherence/awareness
* Each particle / molecule has a tendency to enter into partnership - they don’t behave randomly. (See tendencies)
* Hidden depth in all matter; source is divine creative power (imagination of romantics)
* In humans, experien ed as subjectivity: thoughts, emotions, desires, self-awareness.  Angels and animals experience variations on this.
* Minerals experience is less as awareness of self, but of furthest reaches of universe, of abstractt laws, yet it is as complex and profound and connected. 
* Awareness of chain to god. 
* Stimulating ferment / enzyme
* God > within > objects evolution > OP


## **Appendix**

## Besides efficient cause, there’s final cause (purpose / intent) + formal cause (subtantial / accidental) 
Examples in living & non-living
Matter / forces / physical laws
## Two kinds of forces. 


## Final Cause / Formal cause
* final cause is a cause because it gives efficient reason to act
* Efficient cause if a cause of fc because it initiates motion. 
* A thing is potentially many things, but efficient cause gives it a specific final cause.  

## Nonliving
* Matter: clay
* Form: malleable / clump
* Final cause: statue
* Efficient cause: sculpture

## Living (acorn/oak)
* Matter: molecules
* Form: an acorn
* Final cause: an oak
* Efficient cause: essence of oak

* in both cases, is final cause a thing or a function
* Final cause of a chair is to be sat upon; not to be a chair for example. 
* So: oak - is to be an rooted entity that can annually reproduce
* Statue - to be the likeness of an individual that excites admiration
* In the living, efficient cause exists within acorn, and exists as the moon : sun, reflection of god
* In non-living, EC is a living person, who contains FC as an idea, which itself is a reflection of a prototype, which reflects aspect of god. 

## In both cases, the form gradually changes until final cause achieved; until form = final cause. 

## Matter / forces
* The properties of matter, like mass, charge, and interactions with other particles, determin its behavior.  EM force governs interaction between charaged particles.  The gravitational force influences the motion of objects of mass.  The structure of matter also influence.  
## Physical laws 
* matter is foundational
* It has regularities, patterns, behavior, properties.
* Laws describe these.  
* These regularities will change as matter transforms over time.  Novel interaction over time. 

## Does collective whole have a form. 

## Two tendencies of entities
* desire to enter into ever-more complex relationships to which they contribute and become transparent.  This is a movement towards unification;  unfold
* Enfold: tendency towards invention; more novel forms; new tools? 

## Force 1
* Binding together;
* Chaos > order
* Simplicity > complexity
* Inwardness > convergence
* Verticality
* Ascent to higher levels
* Intuition
## Force 2
* Highlighting difference / uniqueness; maintaining identity 
* Divergence
* Novelty
* Unpredictability
* Self-preservation; serpent; technology; knowledge; analysis
* Desire to fracture
* Order > chaos
* Complexity > simplicity

## Hence 2 groups will similiarly come together but in unique ways.


## Appendix

## cognitive dominates biosphere, frees itself from physical - is this a gnostic narrative? AI frees itself from hardware and leaps into biology - seems more materialistic - good. Is biology better than hardware? 

## Are the laws of langauge (grammar) similar to the laws of physics.  
How are each related to thinking?  
(Do teach language allow ai to think?) 
do Laws that regulate langauge also regulate biology and matter? 

## What four rules make up language? Language consists of four rules: phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and semantics

## Is the final cause a thing’s potential to become what they become? 
So does the behavior of matter come from where? 
Is this a future stage of humanity or is this a presence that gave rise to, guided, and attracts humanity? 
Is Teilhard’s “interiority” or “withinness” similiar to Aristotle’s final cause?


The Great Attractor (god)

The identity of this tree has to do with its shape, lines, colors, and behavior.

This particular tree, like all trees or all things, only happens to exist, but need not exist.   

Existence is not a part of its identity; nor is it an attribute of its identity; instead, it is the condition of its identity.  Without the existence, which is other than itself, it would not exist.  Being other than itself, its relation is primarily one of participation.   

We participate in existence in a similar way to which we participate in the sun.  We are not the sun, nor its rays, nor are these attributes, and yet we participate in its action, were sustained by its power. 

We can only receive it, not possess it.  It is gift, and it is not ours to give.  We are transformers, not givers of existence.  

And this particular tree did not bring itself into being.  If it did, it would be existence itself.  Rather, Its existence is contingent on other things.
