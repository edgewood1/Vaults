# note


Angels need matter as “reflectors”
What do they see in these mirrors? Pour in?
How do they respond to their seeing? Pour in? 

Dark matter might be the “matter” from whihc they operate.
Dark energy might be the force that they exert.

How does dark energy affect teh earth? 

Walking is exercise

Mindfulness requires sitting
It is observation receptive
Receptivity means something will stand out for you 
You pan out and observe context
Zoom in behold afterimage

You ask who are you?
Practice listening 
You ask who are you in me?
Practice listening
Later reflect.  Consider after image what comes
