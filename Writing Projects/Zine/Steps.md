Physical and immateria substance

My limbs chest gut head are memngers of the physical

A psychic landscape full of diving thoughts sensations images emotions make up my consciousness. 

A physical body and a consciousness body.  

Bc plants and animals show awareness they also have consciousness though not of the same sort

Our consciousness is externally based.  As we move down the chain we see a turning away from the external and towards the internal.  What is the internal?   

If the external dwells on the physical world. Surrounding g. The internal dwells on an internal immaterial world

We experience on that aspect of the world that concerns out experience in the external. But plants have feelers that extend further 

The divide between worlds is called the veil. That work has its own interior world. This movement towards world more and more subtle is called.   

Human bodies are aware of their internal lives but are blind the to the internal world they find themselves in.  All their energies have been driven to penetrate the physical. 

Animals have been less ambitious in the physical and their vision extends to the horizon of their internal landscape. 

Plants are said to peer deeper into this landscape such that they perceive agencies that roam more subtle worlds



In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. 

However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [fundamental forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_forces) by introducing [extra dimensions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_dimensions)/[hyperspace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace). Most notably, [superstring theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory) requires 10 spacetime dimensions, and originates from a more fundamental 11-dimensional theory tentatively called [M-theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory) which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. [Supergravity theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergravity_theory) also promotes 11D spacetime = 7D hyperspace + 4 common dimensions. To date, no direct experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If hyperspace exists, it must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be "curled up" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments

The Bohr atom included negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus at specific median distances. These distances are represented by spheres, called *shells*, surrounding the nucleus. Electrons can move from shell to shell. When an electron absorbs enough energy, it moves to a larger, or higher, shell. When it loses a certain amount of energy, it falls to a smaller, lower shell.

**When an electron absorbs energy**, it jumps to a higher orbital. This is called an excited state. An electron in an excited state can release energy and 'fall' to a lower state.

astral body / etheric dimensions
When we close our eyes, we are in our astral bodies // pure chaos
The goal is to move outside this body into the etheric
we can use an immaterial object to get us there
etheric body / astral dimension? 
We know we are there when astral activy calms
When there is nothing but our object.
Then we release the object and we are left with echos of it
The goal is to move outside these echos and enter the ego
egoic body / ??

Second attempt
1. Restlessness / animal state - focus to over come it; one enters etheric body 
2. Calmness / vegetative state - release to over come it; through the astra body
3. Numbness / mineral state - from nothing, there arises novelty; egoic-consciousness

I possess forces that enables me to experience self with full consciousness in my physical body as a human; but to achieve this clarity in the higher members of my being, I don’t have the strength / forces. I must achieve this force through practice. This is why I meditate. 

It’s actually not so much that we lack forces, but that there are other forces obstructing us. Our lack of strength is the result of forces of a moral nature. 
Numbness is not natural; it acts upon the whole of minerality and upon human nature - it prevents us from arriving at our place of insight.
