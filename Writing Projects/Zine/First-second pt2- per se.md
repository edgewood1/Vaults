Per se / accidens



Two kinds of efficient cause - one has infinite regression, the other not: 

Direct - necessary to explain universe.  

Indirect - if all relations were non-essential, then there would be no first cause, and the universe would have come into existence by chance. This is because a non-essential cause is not essential to the production of itse effect.  In other words, the effect could have come into existence without the cause.  That is, it would have come into existence by chance.  Just randomly.   But aquinas believed the universe is ordered and not random, so it must have a first cause that is per se necessary. 

Per se needed for knowledge.  If all knowledge were based on pa then our knowledge would be unreliable because per accidens causes are not always present; however we have certain knowledge for the world, thus it must be based on per se.

Essential/ per se
Atemporal / intrinsic / integral- brick thru a window; window smashed.  essential to the nature or definition of a thing. It's a relationship that is inherent, intrinsic, and necessary for the existence or identity of the thing.
- For example, the relationship between a flame and its heat is "per se." Heat is an essential attribute of a flame. Removing heat from a flame would fundamentally change what a flame is.

Nonessential / Per Accidens
Temporal / incidental / contingent on external factors
not essential to the nature of a thing but is associated with it due to external circumstances or conditions. It's a relationship that is accidental or non-essential.
- For example, the relationship between a person and the clothes they are wearing is "per accident." The person's identity is not defined by the clothes they wear, and changing their clothes wouldn't change who they are.

The relationship between ball A and ball C in the scenario you described can be described as both "per accident" and "per se." Let's break down the explanation:

1. **Per Accident Relationship:**
 The interaction between ball A and ball C is not an inherent or essential aspect of either ball's nature. It's a relationship that occurs due to the sequence of events and the transfer of momentum through the intermediate ball B. The interaction is contingent on the specific circumstances and interactions that took place earlier.

2. **Per Se Relationship:**
   On the other hand, there's also an indirect "per se" relationship between ball A and ball C through ball B. Ball A's action of hitting ball B, which subsequently hits ball C, is part of a causal chain where each event is related to the preceding one. This chain of events forms a "per se" relationship, albeit an indirect one, because the movement of ball C is directly influenced by the movement of ball A through the intermediary of ball B.

In summary, the relationship between ball A and ball C is both "per accident" because it's contingent on specific circumstances and events, and "per se" due to the causal chain of events connecting them through ball B. The scenario illustrates the nuanced ways in which "per accident" and "per se" relationships can coexist in a complex series of interactions.

**Per Se Relationship:**
- The focus is on the inherent connection between objects or events within a coherent chain of causality.
- It emphasizes the essential role that each element in the chain plays in contributing to the final outcome.
- In this case, the "per se" relationship acknowledges that ball A's action is part of the entire sequence that leads to the movement of ball C through ball B.
- so a per se perspective looks at A and B as its related to the whole chain.  

**Per Accident Relationship:**
- The focus is on the contingent or incidental connection between objects or events.
- It highlights that the presence or absence of an object or event at a specific moment is not essential to the overall outcome.
- The "per accident" relationship acknowledges that the presence or absence of ball A at the moment ball C began to move is a non-essential factor in the movement of ball C, as the movement is primarily influenced by ball B.

Non-chains: **Brick Breaking a Window:**

- **Per Se Relationship:** In this case, the concept of a "per se" relationship might not be as prominent, as there may not be a clear and structured sequence of events. However, a "per se" relationship could still be present in terms of the inherent nature of the interaction. The brick's impact directly leads to the breaking of the window, and this direct cause-and-effect relationship can be considered a "per se" connection.

- **Per Accident Relationship:** The focus here would likely be on the "per accident" relationship. The brick's impact causing the window to break is contingent on the specific circumstances of the brick's trajectory, force of impact, and the nature of the glass. It's not an essential relationship but rather a result of chance factors.

In cases like this, where there might not be an extended chain of events, the distinctions between "per se" and "per accident" relationships can still help analyze how objects or events relate to each other. While the concept of a chain might not be as apparent, the nature of causality and influence is still at play, and these distinctions can provide insights into the relationships involved.

Could the difference between these two be one of direct vs indirect? When a brick breaks a window, the direct cause is the force of the brick against the fragility of a window and indirect is the angle or strength of the window or momentum or size of the brick, which need to be of a certain quality in order to break the window.  Also, in a chain of effects, the direct cause might be the most recent member in the chain, but the indirect causes might be previous members.

Yes, your interpretation is quite accurate. The distinction between "per se" and "per accident" relationships can indeed be likened to the difference between direct and indirect causes, and your examples help illustrate this well.

**Direct Cause (Per Se):**
- A direct cause is closely associated with the immediate effect and has a more essential or intrinsic connection to it.
- In your example of the brick breaking a window, the direct cause is the force of the brick hitting the fragile window. This cause is directly connected to the effect of the window breaking.

**Indirect Cause (Per Accident):**
- An indirect cause is less immediately connected to the effect and might involve additional factors that contribute to the outcome.
- In the same brick and window scenario, the angle, strength of the window, momentum, or size of the brick might be indirect causes. While they play a role in the outcome, they are not as directly connected to the breaking of the window as the force of the brick impact.

Additionally, your observation about chains of effects is accurate:

- In a chain of causal events, the most recent cause might be the direct cause of the immediate effect, while previous causes are indirect causes that contribute to the overall outcome. Each link in the chain can be considered a "per se" cause in relation to its immediate effect, while the entire chain can be seen as an overall "per se" relationship between the initial cause and the final effect.

Your interpretation provides a valuable perspective on understanding the distinction between "per se" and "per accident" relationships in terms of direct and indirect causality.
