In the yard before me, there stood the creature dark patchwork bark of a trunk moving up to branches weaving through leaves that swayed in the wind. Roots bound it deep into the earth. Perched above I saw a bird.

Substance

I recognized this creature as a single unified thing—a Primary Substance  But I also recognize it as a "willow oak," the species, also called a Secondary Substance.

Principles of Substance (Form & Matter)

I can focus out and view the tree as a whole.  However, I often drift from part to part: the dark, patchwork bark, the sprawling branches, the green leaves, and the deep roots—these are its Matter, a material that is clearly organized. 

And being organized, there must be an organizing principle—a Substantial Form—a "tree-ness" that gives the entire creature its specific shape, life, and integrity. 

This form and matter are so intimately bound that they make a single, existing thing: Substance.

Principles of Being (Essence & Existence)

The tree is more than just a physical object; it is a reality. "To be or not to be" is the famous quote, and at its root, a thing can have or not have existence as a particular thing in our world. 

The tree's Existence is its most fundamental principle. The particular kind of thing it exists as is its Essence. For this tree, its essence is its unique nature as a "willow oak," a living being with a specific identity.

You asked how essence and form differ. The "tree-ness" you refer to is both, but in different ways. The Substantial Form is the metaphysical principle that causes the tree's Essence. So, the form is the invisible blueprint, and the essence is the complete nature that results from that blueprint informing matter. The terms overlap because they both point to the same "whatness" of the tree.
You also asked if essence implies matter while form does not. For material things, the Essence always implies matter because it is the composite of form and matter. However, the Form itself does not always imply matter; the human soul, for instance, is a form that can exist on its own after death, and the Divine Idea is a form that exists in God without matter.
Principles of Action (Powers & Operations)
As I see the tree sway in the wind, I can see that it is active. But even when it is still, it is active in less visible ways as life courses through its being.
The capacity to photosynthesize, to draw nutrients from the soil, to grow taller and wider, and to provide a home for the bird—these are its Powers, the potentials to act that flow from its essence. These powers are always present, even if not in use.
The silent, constant work of converting sunlight into energy is a perpetual Operation. The slow, unceasing process of thickening its trunk and deepening its roots are also operations—actual expressions of its inherent powers. Swaying in the wind and the unceasing flow of life are also operations.
Principles of Causality (Efficient & Final Cause)
And how did this tree even get here?
The tree's origin can be traced back to a chain of Efficient Causes that brought it into being. The squirrel that buried the acorn, the parent tree that made the acorn, and the sun and rain that nourished it were all proximate causes. But these agents, these secondary causes, were not the ultimate, independent cause. The independent cause is God, who is the ultimate source of all power and being.
But all of these agents, all of these actions, were ultimately moved by a Final Cause. The tree is here for a purpose: to grow to maturity, to bring forth new seeds, to provide shade and shelter for other beings, and in doing so, to express and reflect the goodness of its ultimate Creator. The tree's very existence and all its actions are directed toward this final end.
