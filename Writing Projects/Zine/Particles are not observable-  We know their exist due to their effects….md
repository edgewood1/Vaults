Particles are not observable.  We know their exist due to their effects. We say the same about dark matter and energy.  As well as spirit.  Grace for example I’d the overflow of god.  And this overflow is primarily efficacious. 

Ítems are smaller. Then they seem to reduce to a layer of fields coursing with energy, fields that are the spaces between.

When I turn in I first find a rib cage and a natural breath.  Above a heart and warmth.  The word love.
