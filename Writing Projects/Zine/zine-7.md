In other words, whatever is contingent, not having its existence by virtue of its own nature, must be caused to exist by something else.

Effects are proportionate to cause

“the form of the thing generated pre-exists in the generator according to the same mode of being and in a similar matter, as
When fire generates fire. 

if the effect is not always contained in the cause “formally,” it will yet be contained in it “eminently” or “virtually.” This last principle came to be known within the Scholastic tradition as the principle of proportionate causality. That whatever comes into existence, and more generally that any contingent thing, must have a cause, came to be known as the principle of causality. Aquinas’s dictum that “every agent acts for an end” is known as the principle of finality.

The essence of a thing is just that which makes it the sort of thing it is, “that through which something is a certain kind of being” (DEE 1). It is also that through which a thing is intelligible or capable of being grasped intellectually. Hence to grasp humanity is to grasp the essence of human beings –

Essence is form and general matter
