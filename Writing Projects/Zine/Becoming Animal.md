# Becoming Animal


What does the hawk or butterfly see in a tree?
I walk through the woods.
do i feel safe yet? 
I pulled here and there by the anxieties of the everyday.
do I feel safe yet? 
Enclosed as I am
Then it hits me. 
Was it you that reached out and into me?
Or had all this turmoil opened a space in me, sufficient to pull you in,  

Whatever it was, you’re in.  I notice you, and i sustain notice - your details come to life, evoking my imagination, and one image moves me to contemplation, curiosity: I see your details as absolutely unique, unlike anything.  And this richness awakens me to the details in everything else.  And i see everything else fully engaged and connected to everything else.  

I sense your habitus, your place, and make a home of it.  I return for a visit each season of the year, and it’s this active engagement, this growing history, that slowly elicits a warmth, a deeper empathy, allows me to open this vulnerable space.  

**Part 2**

What does the hawk or butterfly see in a tree?

**Whether they are engaged in play or survival, animals are primarily present.**  

They experience a detailed perception of its object of focus, detecting the smallest cues and variations in what they observes when tracking a target, a danger, a vantage point/shelter

They also use spatial memory and internal compasses to navigate

**Butterflies**

Butterflies have compound eyes with a wider field of view but lower resolution compared to hawks. 

They are particularly sensitive to colors and movement and use cues like flower colours, nectar sources, or suitable leaves for laying eggs.

Additionally, wind currents and light patterns can influence their approach and landing decisions.

Beyond sight, hawks might pick up on sounds of prey rustling in leaves, while butterflies use scent receptors to detect the presence of flower nectar or suitable host plants and touch.

**Emotion**

Both experience some level of anticipation, perhaps excitement for potential prey or satisfaction in finding a suitable location for their needs.

Presence 

Because thought doesn’t interfere with their sensuality, they experience heightened **sensory awareness** , fully immersed in the moment.

Thus they can  reacting instinctively without the burden of past reflections, self-consciousness, guilt, anxieties. 

And still they are capable of problem-solving, planning, and even forms of emotional memory.

Division between self and other

An animal doesn't distinguish between itself and the world, directly experiencing whatever surrounds them without subjective interpretations.  

In contrast, humans perceive themselves as distinct from the world they observe and analyze.

distanced, self-aware consciousness 
- reflect on self as a distinct entity with own thoughts, feeling, and motivations.
- Observing these processes and experiences as object, as third-person, detached perspective, observing yourself, evaluating, self-regulating.
- Seeing you’re nervous, and understanding why you feel this way, and deciding how to manage this.
- Focus on present mental state

Episodic memory
- Focus on past events 
- First-person, reliving the event.
- Includes emotions felt, while self-awareness means observing and analyzing emotions. 
- Recollection.
- May provide raw material for self-awareness. 
- reflect on the past, imagine the future, and create narratives about themselves and the world.  

Because we are burdened, we yearn for meaning, connection, and transcendence, often leading to dissatisfaction and a search for fulfillment.

To escape the limitations of thought and connect with the animal's immediacy, Bataille argues, humans engage in **sacrifice and ritual**. These acts aim to break down the subject-object split and experience a temporary fusion with the world.

- To become animal would mean to lose myself as I know it.  

**Aquinas**

How does Aquinas' model of internal senses apply to animal experience?  

Our internal senses consists of
- intital stimuli via external senses
- Division of sensation into emotion-memory (connecting images to past experiences that have emotional content) and imagatination (image-formation)
- Reunites them as perception via the common sense where the intellect can manage it. 

**Animal Experience:**

- animals have more immediate and holistic expierience, directly linking sensation to action without intermediate emotional or memory processing.
- Sensation is most emphasized, pronounced. 
- The following represents a more integrated processing
- However, this doesn't imply animals lack emotions or intuition. They might have simpler, instinctual emotional responses directly tied to their sensory perceptions.
- While lacking full-fledged "episodic memory," animals exhibit forms of sensory-motor memory, allowing them to learn from past experiences without complex mental representations.

Animals likely experience the world in a **more immediate and integrated way**, relying heavily on **instinct, emotions directly tied to sensations**, and simpler forms of memory. 

Could it be that the instinct, intuitions, and emotions already residing in the internal senses is all they have? 

Animals have these internal senses: 

= imagination - they can form mental representations of stimuli - dogs remember walks based on scent. 
- memory - they exhibit short-term working memory and longer term associated memory
- Common sense - they perform actions based on sensory info without complex reasoning

But these are less complex
- no abstraction, thus no symbolism (imagination)
- No episodic memory (memory)
- No self-reflection / self-awareness (common sense)

Animal model 
- input 
- Filter
- Memory stores 
- Limited imagination
- Behavior / output

Sacrifice

humanity as fundamentally caught in a **duality**: that of the **subject (self)** and the **object (other)**. 

This split separates us from the world and from our own animalistic nature. 

He believed that both **sacrifice** and **ritual** act as ways to **transgress this duality**, offering a temporary escape from the limitations of thought and connecting us with the raw, unmediated experience of existence. Here's a breakdown of each:

**Sacrifice:**

* In Bataille's view, sacrifice isn't about appeasing deities or seeking favor. It's about **giving up something valuable, irreversibly**: an animal, an object, even a part of oneself.
* This act of **destruction** disrupts the self's control and sense of ownership, creating a feeling of **surrender** and **fusion with the world**.
* The sacrifice becomes a bridge, momentarily dissolving the boundaries between self and other.

**Ritual:**

* Rituals, for Bataille, involve **symbolic actions and repetitions** that follow specific patterns.
* These rituals can involve chanting, singing, dancing, or other forms of performance.
* By participating in these collective rites, individuals **transcend their individuality** and merge with the group, experiencing a shared sense of **communion and belonging**.
* The emphasis is not on the meaning of the actions, but on their **power to evoke** emotional and collective experiences.

**Together, Sacrifice and Ritual:**

* By breaking down the subject-object duality, both sacrifice and ritual can lead to a state of **ecstasy**. This isn't a blissful feeling, but rather a **disturbing and intense fusion** with the world, potentially bordering on chaos and death.
* This experience provides a glimpse beyond the ordinary limitations of thought and language, connecting us to the raw energy and interconnectedness of life.

**Important Points:**

* Bataille's ideas are challenging and controversial, often involving themes of violence, sexuality, and transgression.
* His views on sacrifice and ritual aren't meant to be literal prescriptions, but rather a philosophical exploration of ways to overcome the limitations of human existence.
* Different interpretations and critiques exist regarding Bataille's work, and further research is encouraged for a deeper understanding.

**To Conclude:**

For Bataille, sacrifice and ritual aren't acts of barbarity or superstition, but rather ways to escape the confines of selfhood and experience a fleeting, intense immersion in the raw, interconnected nature of existence. While his ideas might seem extreme, they offer a unique perspective on human desire and our inherent yearning for connection beyond the limitations of individual thought.
