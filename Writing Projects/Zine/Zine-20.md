In the beginning,

In the future, Cherubim are called teh spirit of harmony because the mediate between love and will.

Seraphim / Spirits of Love- stand before God as ministering servants in the heavenly court; the burning ones.  They contemplate god’s plan. to create man and an environment in which he can evolve, i.e. the solar system. Their contemplation is at the same time a creative act that brings a world into existence in a purely spiritual form. One might look upon it as an ‘idea’ world.

——-

Initially, they are created and guided, and then eventually creating and guiding and redeeming. 

In the process of the development, these creatures change from being a receiver to being a giver. As a child he receives; as an adult, he gives. At first they receive; later they are in a position to give. Thus the highest Hierarchies can give of their substance to create the world and man. The lower ones work under their direction and in so doing further their own development

As they evolve, some members fail to reach the goal or purposely forego a normal development. There are thus a whole series of retarded beings who might be termed Spirits of Adversity. They are not evil in themselves but they provide adverse influences with which man has to deal.

When it’s time to create, the hierachies provide substance, then impulse and stimuli to awaken essence and  activity.  The latter is changed into inner life, which then proceeds under its own impetus angels becomes creative.  (Life). Thus, the world around us are the preserved thoughts of the gods.
