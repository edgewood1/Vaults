# zine: glossary


1. <u>Here are the revised definitions, formatted as a concise glossary.</u>

**Substance:** A complete, independent reality that exists in itself and acts as a subject (e.g., a tree, a dog, a rock, an angel). It is the "whole thing" available to the senses and cognition. (Note: An idea is *not* a substance because it depends on a mind to exist).
**Integral Part:** A constituent of quantity consisting of the physical "chunks" that make up the body of a substance. These parts, such as the branches and leaves of a tree, are spatially distinguishable and can be physically severed from the whole.
**Metaphysical Part (Principle):** A foundational block that structures reality—such as essence, existence, form, or power—which is real but not an independent object. A helpful analogy is the **steepness** of a hill: while the hill is the object (substance), the steepness is a real principle that has physical effects (causing you to roll), yet it cannot be dug out or separated from the hill like a rock could.
**Accident (Quality):** A modification or attribute of a thing that depends on the substance to exist. It typically describes the condition of the object, such as the greenness of a leaf, which can change or be lost without destroying the substance itself.
**Proper Accident (Proprium):** A specific type of quality that flows necessarily from the essence of a thing. For example, the **roundness** of a ball is technically a quality of shape (an arrangement of parts), but because a ball is defined by this shape, the roundness is functionally essential; if the roundness is lost, the material remains, but the "ball" is ruined.
**Idea:** A mental representation that exists as a quality of the mind rather than as an independent substance. While it is not a principle of the external object (it doesn't make the tree exist), it serves as the **principle of knowledge**, or that *by which* we know the object.


1. <u>Here are the revised definitions. I have used rhetorical and slightly poetic language to help the "mind's eye" see the distinction between these invisible concepts.</u>
**1. Substance (The Anchor)**
The "Noun" of Reality.
An independent reality that stands on its own two feet. It is not a feature of something else; it is the thing itself—the stage upon which all other qualities dance. It acts as the anchor that holds all attributes together.
* *Example:* The **Tree** itself.
**2. Integral Part (The Chunks)**
The "Slices" of the Body.
The physical building blocks that fill out the dimensions of a thing. These are parts you can map with a ruler and sever with a saw. They exist side-by-side in space, like distinct rooms in a house.
* *Example:* The **Branches** and **Roots**. (You can cut them off, and they fall to the ground).
**3. Metaphysical Part (The Invisible Architecture)**
The "Skeleton" of Being.
The fundamental principles that hold a thing together from the inside out. You cannot dig these out with a shovel or cut them with a knife, yet they are as real as gravity. They are the invisible "steel beams" of reality that structure the object and make it what it is.
* *Example:* The **Form** (the blueprint of "Treeness") or the **Existence** (the energy of being real).
**4. Accident (The Costume)**
The "Shadow" on the Walker.
A feature that clings to a substance like paint to a canvas. It cannot exist on its own—you never see "tallness" walking down the street, only a "tall man." It is a fleeting reality that borrows its existence entirely from the substance it modifies.
* *Example:* The **Location** of the tree ("In the garden").
**5. Quality (The Flavor)**
The "Texture" of the Soul.
A specific type of accident that gives a thing its character. It answers the question, "What is it like?" It is the "adjective" that colors the noun, describing the disposition, shape, or ability of the object.
* *Example:* The **Roughness** of the bark or the **Vitality** of the sap.
**6. Idea (The Mental Mirror)**
The "Internal Map."
A ghost of the object that lives inside the mind. It is not the independent reality itself, but a representation—a mental lens we look through to recognize and understand the world outside.
* *Example:* The **Concept of a Tree** in your memory that allows you to recognize an Oak when you see one.


1. <u>These are a solid start. You have grasped the core intuitions—especially the distinction between "spatial chunks" (integral) and "structural causes" (metaphysical).However, a few of your definitions need tightening to avoid philosophical traps (specifically regarding</u> <u>**Accidents**</u> <u>and</u> <u>**Qualities**</u><u>).</u>
**Critique of Your Drafts**
1. **Substance:** "Distinguishable from what it is not" is too broad (everything is distinguishable). The key to substance is **Independence**. It stands alone.
5. **Integral Parts:** "Spatially distinguishable" is perfect.
7. **Metaphysical Parts:** "Causes the whole" is excellent.
9. **Accident:** You defined this as a "change." An accident isn't just the *change*; it is the **attribute itself**(whether it changes or stays the same). Even if a leaf stays green forever, "greenness" is still an accident.
15. **Quality:** "Sensual aspect" is too narrow. A "virtue" (like bravery) or a "skill" (like math) is a quality, but you can't see or touch it. Quality is simply "how a thing is."
17. **Idea:** "Mental principle" is a great way to phrase it.

1. <u>**The Refined Definitions**</u><u>;Here is the polished version, tightening the vocabulary to match the metaphysical framework we have built.</u>
1. Substance (The Subject)
An independent reality that exists in itself and not in another. It is the "whole thing" that serves as the subject for all other attributes.
* *Correction:* It is more than just being distinct; it is about **independent existence**. (e.g., The dog itself).
2. Integral Part (The Quantitative Component)
A physical element of a substance that has quantity and extension. These parts are spatially distinguishable from one another and can potentially be severed from the whole, though they depend on the whole to function.
* *Key:* Spatially distinct. (e.g., The dog's leg).
3. Metaphysical Part (The Constitutive Principle)
A fundamental principle that structures or causes the being of the substance. These are not spatially distinguishable "things," but are the reality-components that make the object what it is.
* *Key:* Structurally distinct, but physically inseparable. (e.g., The dog's Soul/Form).
4. Accident (The Dependent Attribute)
A reality that does not exist in itself but exists in a substance. It is a modification or characteristic of the substance. While substances are, accidents belong to.
* *Correction:* It is not the "change" itself; it is the *feature* that is capable of changing. (e.g., The dog's location, relation, or action).
5. Quality (The Mode)
A specific type of accident that modifies the nature or form of the substance. It describes "what kind" or "how" the object is.
* *Correction:* It is not limited to "sensual aspects." It includes shape, color, abilities, habits, and disposition. (e.g., The dog's color *or* the dog's obedience).
6. Idea (The Mental Sign)
A mental representation of an object that exists as a quality of the mind. It is dependent on the intellect.
* *Role:* It serves as the **Principle of Knowledge**. It is the internal tool *by which* we grasp the external reality.

<u>**Version 1**</u>

When I’m see your branches swaying, I’m really looking at a part of you - the parts that are your branches and leaves - rather than the whole of you - which would be called “substance”.  And even then, I’m looking at a temporary part of you - what the ancients would call “accidents” - rather than the more permanent part of you.  

But when I look with eyes, these temporary and partial aspects are all that I can grasp.  

**III. The Layers of Inquiry: The Ascent to Permanence**

Two questions: 
* I there a more permanent and holistic aspect is beyond my grasp (is this the divine idea? The essence? The substantial form?). 
* Would such a permanent or “real” aspect be the cause o father plants being and movement (for it to move implies it must be)
* What causes the branches to move? And to be? 

When I watch your branches sway, I realize this movement is fleeting—a temporary ripple in your existence. To find what is permanent, I must look deeper. My inquiry begins with the motion itself, leading me to ask about the **Powers** that allow you to move and the external **Forces** that push you. But these forces only affect you because you are a tree, which drives me to investigate the deeper laws of your **Form** and **Essence**. Yet, even these internal structures are created; ultimately, my search for your most permanent reality leads me upward, to the unchangeable **Divine Idea** that defined you before the world began. By following this path from the fleeting to the fundamental, we discover the four fields of reality

**== version 2 is here…** 

<u>**Appendix**</u>

Essence - potential aspect of substance, but it is also capable of an actualizing aspect, called form.  Essence is called “secondary substance” and is included in the “primary substance”, which composes all.  Angels lack a distinction between primary/secondary due to the non-presence of matter. 
Existence - actualizing aspect of essence that enables essence/form.

<u>***Fields***</u>

Altnatives 
so I might ask: what makes you a tree and not a building?

And this brings me back to the question of form and essence.  

With each consecutive question, I realize that the answer is not a single statement, but a tension between two contending forces: Act (Expansion) and Potency (Contraction), two forces that contend across a series of fields.

IV. The Field of Action: Dynamism
My search begins with the swaying branches. Is the movement coming from you? In this Field of Action, the expansive force is Operation (the act of swaying). It is an outpouring of energy seeking expression. However, it is limited by the specific capacity of the Power (the faculty of flexibility). The faculty contracts the general energy of the tree into a specific, focused movement. As a result, you do not perform "infinite motion," but only the specific swaying allowed by your nature.

V. The Field of Becoming: Causality
Recognizing that you did not move yourself, I look outward to the wind. In this Field of Becoming, I analyze the context of your change. Here, the Efficient Cause (the Wind/Agent) represents the expansive potential; it has the power to push in many directions. The Final Cause (the Balance of Pressure) acts as the contraction. The goal focuses the wind's chaotic potential into a specific necessary path. Unlike the other fields which compose you, this field describes your history.

VI. The Field of Matter: Hylomorphism
Having explained the motion, I look at you, the object being moved. What structures your physical body? In the Field of Matter, the organizing power of Form meets the restraining force of Matter. Your Form is the expansive ideal that wants to express the perfect structural plan of "Treeness." Your Matter is the contracting density that "weighs down" the form. It contracts the perfect idea into a heavy, breakable object at a single point in space.

VII. The Field of Being: Real Distinction
Finally, I ask the deepest question: what makes this structure real? In the Field of Being, the expansive perfection is Existence. It is the raw "urge to be" which pours out without internal boundaries. Your Essence acts as the filter or mold that meets this force and says, "Shine here, and like this, and no further." By contracting the infinite possibility of existence, essence shapes it into you—a specific finite reality. Without the limit of essence, you would be indistinguishable from God; without the content of existence, you would be nothing.


Binary

This part consists of two aspects in binary opposition to one another - an expansive and contrastive aspect.  The expansive act wants to fill the room, but the contractile aspect is a system of restrictions, forcing this expansiveness into a particular form.  The restriction is not a loss but a focus. It forces the air through a system that creates a beautiful specific musical note rather than a chaotic blast of wind. 

This dynamic enters a series of fields.  In 
* the field of being, this dynamic appears as essence and existence. 
* The field of matter: matter form
* The field of action: operation and power
* The field of becoming: efficient / final

The primary such part is the form, which orders the physical materials into a specific body.  

But neither could exist without the essence…. 

these are not mere ideas I project, but a real architecture.
