god and essence
* god’s essence is absolutely simple and one
* God can be imagined as immaterial mind that knows everything.
* Each point of knowing is a different way of understanding his single simple essence (infinite perfection and power).
* Each point of knowing is identical to his essence

Essence and form
* essence can be actualized in many ways, but form is the way is is made to be a real thing.
* Form is the means by which essences is actualized into  a real thing (substance)
* There are so ways essence is actualized into form, resulting in two kinds of substances: 
	* Simple substance: form is identical to essence because there is no composition of matter.  Form in the principal of the substance’s being
	* Complex substance: form is the principal that actualizes the essence in matter constituting substance. Form turns matter into a specific thing.

god and the real
* Essence, form, substance, and their relations all assume being
* Being is actualized by god, the prime mover.
* This act of creation is the actualization of God’s knowledge in the world.

Principles and dependencies
* a principle is the ground from which a thing proceeds and on which it depends, yet not separate from it? 
* Without form, there is no substance, yet form is not separate from substance
* Without substance, there is no properties, yet properties are not separate from substance.
