2. Counterfactual: If I were to slice this tree in half, and magnify this cross-section, I would see a ring sapwood where air water  are held.  surrounded by heartwood on the interior and bark on the exterior.  All three absorb / radiate degrees of heat.  
3. *Feeling world:* 

Find any tree

See it as an old friend from ages back.  An old intimate whim yiu have missed.  Notice it’s setting. Let the scene settle in.  The space of its unfolding.  Volunteer to be it’s witness to this life it’s care taker 

Before leaving the spot swear fealty and observe closely the way that led you to this spot. EstBkish landmarks on the way.  

Text urn to this spot in two weeks. Feel the excitement of having returned to an old friend. Feel the energy that comes with the initial recognition. Follow thru with your concern and inquire.   Feel it’s story

The teee will speak thru emotional tones felt in your entering into recognition.  Also aesthetically. Tones.  Feelings and shapes and textures and colors notice along side personal concerns that May illicit the noticing. 

This is the movement of the elemental world and if they were to appear to you. 


1. Etheric and Material - these are two aspects of the plant - the feeling is continuously seeking to unify, the material in the form of the subatomic, is seeking to multiply.  The unifiying force wins, as it maintain a particular plant as plant

1. Archetypes - both are orchestrated by dealt specifically with the annual flowering plants, because it was in them that the plant-forming principle seemed to him to become most clearly apparent. They are all, Goethe recognised, built according to a uniform law. Behind the individual types such as the rose, the tulip, the violet, etc., there is a common archetype that encompasses them all and which Goethe calls the [archetypal plant](https://en.anthro.wiki/Archetypal_plant) ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): [Urpflanze](https://anthrowiki.at/Urpflanze)). There must be such a thing, he thinks, because otherwise how could we even recognise that they are all plants. In fact, when we recognise a plant as a plant, this archetypal plant is active in each of us. Only we do not normally become really aware of it, but only of the finished judgement: "That is a plant". We sleep through the actual living thought process that produces this judgement. But this is nothing other than the exact mental image of the original plant itself that is active in nature

1. From above see observation of plant
2. Archetypes are off-shoots of Angels - intelligences.  Our ideas and concept are reflections of our intelligence, both are immaterial.   Our intelligence is a reflector - and the concepts from which we spin ideas are pale and distant reflections of those that compose these creatures.  
 
Every angel is terrifying. And yet, alas, I invoke you,
almost deadly birds of the soul, knowing about you.
But if the archangel now, perilous, from behind the stars took even one step down toward us:  our own heart, beating higher and higher, would beat us to death.

Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'
hierarchies? and even if one of them
pressed me against his heart: I would be consumed
in that overwhelming existence. For beauty is nothing
but the beginning of terror, which we still are just able to endure,
and we are so awed because it serenely disdains
to annihilate us. Every angel is terrifying.

1. And what do these intelligences reflect, and to what do they inspire? What draws them irresistibly, becoming their purpose.   What yearning shapes every aspect of them?  Keeping them bound in the same way the feeling around a tree keeps it bound?  The being at the end (telcos) full grown - being at work staying th same.  The enetelechy.  The intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumpherence is nowhere.  

8 The angelic spheres arose from this, first as emptiness, then as form, then as differentiation.  Berries three principles: differentiation (as astral), subjectivity (as form), and communion (in emptiness)?  This move towards increasing complexity, driving further in

1. Its rays and waves reverberating so densely as to form into archetypes who called out into the space: heat ether

As heat, we lay side by side.  Together we left some behind, who held us as we strayed further ahead, The day I left you to continue on .  And yet aspects of you remained in me since once we were one. 

Eons pass along, as we assume endless forms.  

You were your kind, and I was my kind. 

I remember when my kind recollected your kind and honored. 

Then, came the Kali Yuga, and you were forgotten.  In doing, we forgot an aspect of ourselves. 

But in my life there are moments that surface, memories that lead me outside to you, and we partake in this ancient ritual of recollection, sparking this space we once were, reclaiming it from the darkness that would seek to swallow us both. 

Steps to clairvoyant vision

Description of a tree.  As I walk away.  We were one, we saw a part of ourselves leave, we ourselves leave.
