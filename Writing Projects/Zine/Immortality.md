# Immortality



Can all the gains and ills be reduced to capitalism?   It encourages technological innovation.  But also division of labor and such binaries as body/mind and private/public and male/female.  Isn’t the desire for immortality the desire to live an eternal life of the mind unrestrained by the burdens and pains of the body? If capitalism has marked human bodies it does so primarily as gendered for the sake labor divisions and upon the gender it stamps sexuality, which is  often twisted into a set of associations that help assert power by other means.   This gendering as social construct associated woman with body (to aid with domesticity and reproduction) and men detached from the body to sustain the gruesomeness of war and territorializaltion that mark the public sphere.  This primary distortion.  

But is it capitalism and don’t these divisions occur in nature.  

Human nature itself is associated with symbol making.  While animals and plants practice degrees and rationlith it doesn’t occur to the degree of shaping a fully formed literature or does it?  What does the literary productions of the animal and plant world look like.  I’d like to think it occurs in the higher dimensions and somehow aid in our own ability to create books.  When I see school of fish engage in their deep ocean dances it seems they are engaged in something far more than silly play that they might be engaged in healing some aspect of the earth maybe patching some energetic memory leak through which humanity or the mineral world is losing their nature.  

If nature is primarily oriented towards the good it’s the penchant for forgetting that steers us away towards the horizontal the path of evolution and the serpent as opposed to the alter and the contemplation of the stars.  What is the forgetting that seems more and more common.  It’s often associated with the passage of time and history.  Some say a 1000 years ago we had a stronger relation ship to language which is now
Slipping away.  Some
Say this is good
Because it’s setting us up for the next singularity where we learn a higher form of language more aligned to the animal world.  Others however see this as tragic loss.  Plato argued against writing because it would cause us to lose
Our memories.  This is the first argument against technology. 

So which is it is humanity and nature in a state of decline or progress.  Are we destined to transcend binaries or is binary thought the nature of our 3 dimensional reality.
