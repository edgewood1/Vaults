# Safety: 2-16-24

# 

On some level, self-absorption is associated with insecurity - a lack of safety.

Even when we turn outward and notice, we first gauge how safe we are in relation to it.

Only when this safety is relatively achieved, we can contemplate the other and cultivate respect, and as certainty builds, we can safely narrow the distance.  

The exception is when another intervenes - but even this forces us to reconsider our safety

While neverr fully safe, enough of it can allow us this.  We could still feel relatively unsafe due to past experiences and biases or their outward presentation.

What does contemplation look llore? 

Internal
- When we feel safer, we are willing to step away from our identifications.
- In stepping away, we create a space between ourselves and it.
- In creating a space, we can take stoke of our inner chaos, obser, listen and question.
External
- When we turn away from fixation, we free our gaze
- It takes hold of another, and inches closer
- <u>**Identifying**</u> with your is a form of emapthy

<u>**1-Observe difference of other (sustained attention) How is hte other unique (notice difference)**</u> 

How to turn out and notice the other.   This includes a potential for deterrirorialization but not necessarily Defamiliarization.  We could be driven to notice by pure force of the other. 

- the will / intervention of the other (or self)

Question asking = curiosity.  What caused me to over look (hidden aspects - shadowy parts). why am I preferring thoughts over the production of the sense?  Is the latter not sufficiently beautiful? Might I lack proper context history, aesthetics, or associations to do so? And what is the source of these preferences or baises? 

<u>**Curiosity: result of 1 + 2**</u>
- I want to learn more about your, so I ask questions and experiment.  I’m willing to step outside my comfort zone to engage, despite the unforeseen.  


<u>**2-allowing it to unfold as subjectivit/ Direct Expereince (subjectivity)**</u>


<u>**Hidden aspects (acts of Defamiliarization):**</u> We might imagine the object from the point of view of another who might appreciate this.  We might consider what other variables we’ve overlooked.  And we don’t need an absolute understanding - merely to invoke a hint of mystery that might drive further curiosity.  

creativity = what is the purpose, in our true purpose, we grow towards greater warmth / knowledge, how to organize to get there? 

- In learning more about the other, empathy and kindness grows

How perception acts as a kind of artwork.  

What is Defamiliarization?  Does it instaneously happen when we see art? When we see a picture of a tree, we experience trees in a new way - But this requires an openness - it is a step beyond mere noticing, right? 

What is the difference between observing art and creating art? In both situations we can be altered.  In both, we challenge our perceptions in a similar way, question ourselves, and connect to something larger than both.  Thus we foster transcendence. 

For this to occur, we have to be open to the new, be willing to challenge fixed views and embrace unfamiliar experiences prepares us for encountering and engaging with "otherness."

Subjectivity: I appreciate its value, its right to be, and its potential to become (regardless of present state, I see its nature). This is a neutral step:  

<u>**COMMUNION**</u>

-  responding in kind.  This step is related to curiosity and empathy.

When we do so, we are able to cultivate deeper relationship and engage in service / social justic work that help us overcome isolation and cultivate belonging and interdependence.

(social justice is work that focuses on the good of others and dismantling harmful structures shifts focus beyond personal needs and strengthens community)

I acknowledge our common ground  as two vulnerable creatures on earth. I try to understand the other’s limits, fears, motivations.  

Empathy / curiosity lead to imagination

<u>**Empathy: result of 2 + 3**</u>
- In addition to knowing what you’re going through, I understand and feel what you’re going through. This occurs in degrees

Effects of Curiosity and empathy: 
- stimulate new ideas about what is and what is possible.
- I want to create, explore, play via images and perspectives tat come with stories and scenarios.  
- I learn about your potentials.
- This require I disrupt my habits, question assumptions, 
- Without judgment
- I am vulnerable and take a risk.  

<u>**What happens when we notice**</u>

When we notice the other outside ourselves, we break <u>**identification**</u> with our thought or emotion, creating space between ourselves and it. 

Through this space, we might gain a new perspective on our thoughts.   We might see/think differently about them. re see/rethink our thoughts.  Recognize patterns, biases, impulses. We might expose hidden aspects of ourselves and questioning our assumptions Self-awarenes reveals the ways factors such as bias construct our perception

While looking outward, We might compare the grace of a mountain to our own. .

If we practiced non-judgment towards ourselves, it’s easier to observe others without judgment, fostering deeper self-awareness.  Aware of ourselves, feel sympathy not shame.  Sympathy for self makes it easy to sympathyize with the other, allowing for curiosity. 

How to turn the other into a journey (vs a destination) that takes time, detours, and may remain incomplete.  

<u>**Effect/Notice:**</u> When I sense your potency and benevolence, I strengthen your connection to your source and purpose as well as that of mine to my own.  Reminded of these connections, we grow truer, we offer more to the world. 

<u>**Beyond respect-  Warmth**</u>

Warmth towards the other goes beyond mere intellectual recognition of value.  It involves an emotional resonance, a feeling of connection and safety that draws us to the person, makes us want to engage with them on a deeper level 

Positive and warm perceptions often play a key role in facilitating personal growth and resolution of concerns.  

When i see you as warm, i sense my own warmth, which reinforces my own positive self-image and sense of morality (red road?). 

Of these, I might consider warmth; if I reflect on the memory of an old friend, my heart warms. 

<u>**Obstacles to warmth**</u>

When I see you as warm, I change.  I soften the edges, which helps us feel safer.

The principles can lead to warmth, but only if we address obstacles to emotional connection:
personal compatibility: shared values, interests, and humor spark deeper connections and build emotional bridges
past experiences - negative interactions and unresolved conflicts are barriers, even if there’s mutual respect
individual temperament: some naturally gravitate towards warmth wile others prefer more reserved interactions.   

concusión: effects - TRUE SELF

The notion of “true self” aligns with one’s essence, which refers to the intrinsic nature or core reality of an indiviso.  Seeing others with warmth is a way of acknoelgin and connectin with the inherent value and essence of individuals.  

Growing closer to your essence involves aligning your actions and beliefs with the core principles that define your true self.  Acts of kindnsess, understanding and can be considered expressions of virtues that lead toward teh realization of your true self.  

What is it about warmth and the true self? 

The connection between warmth and the true self involves the idea that positive, empathetic connections Forster authenticity and self-discovery.  When we approach ourselves or others with warmth and sympathy, there is a tendency to create authentic connections.  Authenticity involves being true to oneself, expressing genuine emotions, and forming relationship based on sincerity.  Positive interactions and genuine connection prompt people to engage in self-reflection, exploring values, beliefs, and aspirations, question whether their actions align with their true selves or if they are influencd by external expections.  Also, warmth and sympathy can be an indicator of whether our feelings and responses are in harmony with our true self or with society’s expections.  Warmth encourages openness and vulnerability.  Warmth doesn’t guarantee a direct path to one’s true self, it does create conditions conducive to self-exploration and authenticity, which leads us closer to our true self. 

Nature or society? 

Practicing warmth and searching for a true self in nature vs society.  In nature, there is often a serene and uncomplicated environment, absence of social exomplexity.  This can allow us to explore the self nad reflect without external distractions.  We can connect with natural rhythms, fostering a sense of grounding.  Without distraction its easier to create a space for introspection and self-reflection.  The absence of societal pressure allows for a more un disturbed exploration of one’s thoughts and emotions.  In society, we have more diverse perspectives, experiences, and relationships contributing to a richer understanding of oneself through contracting values and beliefs.  Social interactions provide challenges and opportunities for growth.  Navigating relatinships, understanding others, and practicing empathy lead to self-awareness and development.  Society often mirrors back aspects of ourself.  Interactions provide feedback, helping us gain insights into behavior.  A balance between both is ideal.  

When the heart is warm, my view of you warms, and I see more deeply into you and our shared yet hidden history.

This history extends back to the moments preceding the world’s creation.  It extends forward to the present, where it permeates the surrounding air, light, and landscape.  And this history becomes me. 

In these moments, I uncover our mutual concerns:  our mutual thread-hold on the world, and our perplexing desire to both maintain and release our grip.  
 
When I see you with warmth, I become a stream of images that touches even upon the most mundane concerns, such as what “tomorrow might hold” or “from where might our happiness arise”. 

When i see with warmth, I find we share similar struggles, embodied as similar insights.  We call those images that speak to concern - we call them “insights”.  

And any insight gained into you is one gained into me. 

Who gains insight here? The two observers? The tree’s ideal, who is ever-observing / experiencing its own substance?

The ideal’s insight is direct; insight experienced from intuition is direct; from reason, is layered by interpretation.  What does patanjali say about clear intuition? 

Narrative: I walk into the woods, weighed by concern.  I fi set an intention and open myself to the other, insights into my concern arise: this is my home, I’m connected in silence. I know what to do. 

But this place might also gain an insight into me and myself.   I walk through a sea of essence, overseen by many intelligences which are ordered by the Devas. 

And from where do these insights arise, but the elementals of old.  Those creatures of shadow and light that lurk and spring from leaf, its color and texture.  

However, when I observe with apathy, I undermine our connection to the world, I weaken you and myself, and from these, we inadvertently add to the discord and disease of the world.  

Besides Defamiliarization, there is also reterritorialization.  

Reterritorialization, in Deleuzian thought, refers to the process of taking a previously established territory (a set of desires, habits, beliefs, etc.) and inserting it into a new context or framework. This act disrupts and reorganizes the existing connections within the territory, potentially creating new and unforeseen outcomes.
Connection to Desiring-Production:
* Desire-production, as you stated, involves the constant flow and connection of desires as they interact with the world. It's a dynamic process where boundaries constantly shift and new connections emerge.
* Reterritorialization echoes this dynamism. By disrupting existing connections within a set of desires, it creates the potential for new desires to emerge, existing desires to connect in different ways, and the entire flow of desiring-production to be reorganized.
Examples:
* A person interested in art but stuck in a corporate job might reterritorialize their life by taking a painting class, connecting their artistic desires with a new learning environment. This potentially leads to new desires related to the art community, expression, or even career change.
* Someone stuck in a negative pattern of thinking might reterritorialize their thinking by starting a mindfulness practice. This disrupts the established connections between thoughts and emotions, potentially leading to new ways of relating to them and changing the flow of thoughts and desires.
