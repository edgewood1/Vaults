# freedom


1. motive - motivated by principle translated into a situation.
2. desire - mere want / take-leave 
3. instinct - strong feeling / programming
4. urge - can’t be denied except under serious deprogramming


motive is usually used like this: 
- a rationale for doing something.
- that person hurt me; if I hurt them back, I will feel better because revenge is natural 
- so i hurt him - lots of ways to do it, but this seems best and I can even picture it.
- motive: he hurt me

or 

- altruism is good, and translated to this situation it looks like X
- I will do X
- motive: mental image of your giving 5 dollars.  Lots of ways to help him.
So one has to do with reasoning and the other intention
