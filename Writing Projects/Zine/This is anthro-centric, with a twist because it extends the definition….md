This is anthro-centric, with a twist because it extends the definition of human to include th at natural world. 

Intro

Division / Densification
1. Our solar system is undergoing evolution., and the earth-human reflect its current state. 
2. As part of the evolution, the system has moved from immaterial to material substance, allowing for greater modes of diversification and reflective-thought on part of human, which allows for communion / reconciliationamong the diverse parts.  
3. As the human evolves, the residue is seen in the earth itself.  
4. Saturn the earth was a mass that contained humans in infant stage 
5. As the hierarchies-human evolved, the residue = the earth, also evolving.  The earth is a reflection of human-hierarchy evolution.   
6. When the human disconnects from the earth, the earth’s system becomes more chaotic.
7. Human emotional health is reflected in the planet’s physical health.  This connection likely inspired ancient communities to assemble in order to offer (non-blood) sacrifice to the gods because the planet thrives from our non-utilitarian and contemplative acknowledgment of it.  See quote

History
1. The planet is the complex of 4 kingdoms: mineral, plant, animal, and human.  The human contains the other 3 kingdoms within, and the 3 kingdoms without are extensions of the human, as is the solar system and the hierarchies.     
2. On the one hand, the non-material past still exists with us in the form of hyper-dimensions.   On the other, the material past reflects the non-material.   Local evolution as mineral > plant > animal > human. 
3. Evolution moves in two directions.   
4. Spatially - plant becoming animal ? 
5. Temporal - While densification occurs, traces of past states continue within it, thus creating a multidimensional consciousness forming a kind of cosmic memory.  This is likely at play on a local level allowing us to talk about the memory inherent in a place.  

Evolution
1. Evolution is an on-going process of division and diversification as well as communion.  So far division and diversification has played a major role, and an aspect of this has been a movement from the universe moving from immaterial to material substance, which has enabled greater division and diversification.  
2. Currently we have a solar system divided into separate planets and an earth divided into 4 kingdoms, all of which are materially focused.
3. Eventually these divisions will reconcile into a higher form whose substance will de-condense, becoming more malleable / fluid.  
4. The result will be a solar system whose entities are in transparent communion with one another
5. Densification.An analogy might be vague thoughts or intuitions.  Definitions.  Vivid imaginations.  

Gaiosphy talks about this: 
Man’s uninhibilted amoral conduct will result in violent reactions in the atmosphere, the circulation of the water, and the earth’s crust.   A higher wisdom … unleashes counterforces such as hailstorms and volcanic eruptions when man is tempted to pursue comfort and luxury in order to ensure that man’s spiritual development does not stagnate.  The earth and the human are closely related.  Humans must make it possible for the Earth as an organism to pursue its own development.  In doing so, humans also lay down the conditions for their own developement and that of their companions: the kingdoms of nature and the hierarchies. 

The hierarchies refer to immaterial beings that are co-creators in the earth processes.
