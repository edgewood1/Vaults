# Safety/Warmth - final



SAFETY

When I see you, dear tree, i feel safe.  

However, there have been times I have not felt safe among your kind.  Tree branches have fallen with such force near me.  Had they fallen on me, I’d be no more.  So for some trees, I’d admire from a distance. 

RESPECT

Standing safely before you, I notice how radically distinct you are from any other Oak I’ve ever seen - your shape, color.  

And while you stand apart from the landscape, I’m reminded how this distinctness makes you no better than any other object, which also is radically distinct. 

And I imagine the ways each object is connected to all the other objects, I imagine a singular field whose waves pass through one object and then another.  Sun streams into tree, tree streams into soil, soil streams into fungi network, network, streams into other trees.  

The celestial, the terrestrial, and the subterranean.

WARMTH

**Seeking my own safety is an automatic response, but seeking to notice the object before us is not - where does such a leap come from?  What are the steps from indifference to noticing to admiring?** 

1. Apathy to noticing

I walk though the woods, lost in my own thoughts. 

Two ways: 

I can leave things to chance.  And what is chance, but the intervention of higher forces. 

We also realize chance through the physical dynamics and desires of the other: a sudden gust of wind rustling the leaves, a bird fitting though the branches, or the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, sunlight hitting its leaves just right, birdsong filling the air, the rough texture, pattern, and coloring of the bark, the earthy scene of the forest floors, the place of the tree, the day in which is arises, the weather that swirls through it.  

It’s these things that can draw the attention. 

- or beyond - a higher element within us or outside us. 

Or i could stop.  Cultivate a receptivity, openness, curiosities.  This would increase the likelihood of an encounter.  

Without these, the most stunning tree might disappear into the background noise of our daily lives.  However, such a state, unevenly assumed, could disuade certain insights.   

And without this, the stunning tree can still penetrate the defense.  

- This receptivity can be cultivated through practice via regular mindfulness, focused walks in nature, or even engaging with art – all these contribute to developing a sharper eye / ability to appreciate. 

1. Noticing to Admiration

If my attention is sustained, I might notice the intricate patterns of the bark, the way the branches reach towards the sky, the vibrant green of the leaves against the blue sky.  

Memory/Imagination: shape evokes a childhood memory, or the chirping of the birds evokes a familiar song.

Emotion: The tree calms me, moves me in its grandeur, inspires resilience.  

Intellect: I consider its place in the ecosystem, its connection to the earth and the sun, its journey through time.

Curiosity: I want to learn more about the species of the tree, its history in the area, or the role it plays in the local ecosystem. 

Need: deserate need to connect, communicate, commune with another.  our underlying unease and longing are in continual need of solace that only beauty can offer. 

**Does this call come from the tree or ourselves?** 

- The tree has a soul, personality, a set of inherent qualities: its shape, color, texture, and place in the environment
- It calls us via energetic channels, prompting us to stop and acknowledge their presence, pulling us from our daze and inviting admiration.

- The tree contains a silent history, it has an intricate connection to the ecosystem, which beckons us closer to unravel its secrets.  
- Karma? We imprint / stamp ether (check Steiner  quote)

****Finding it Within:****

- We can project ourselves upon this beings, and thus read ourselves in a new light.
- We could observe silently, slow down and engage, discover the beauty in the ordinary. 

Both the other and the self work together in this way.  Summary: at one point, I wrote about the way perception passed between object and person such that it was co-created by both?

**The solution to unease lay outside us, in beauty / wonder of the world.  Why outward?**

**Defamiliarization**

Unfamiliar / Extraordinary  - disrupts / can pull us out of ourselves.  Distracts us from the ordinary.
Ordinary / familiar - objects and routines can become intrusive reminders of your internal struggles.

Defamiliarization - the device whereby language is used in such a way that ordinary and familiar objects are made to look different. It is a process of transformation where language asserts its power to affect our perception. It is that aspect which differentiates between ordinary usage and poetic usage of language, and imparts a uniqueness to a literary work.  This is a source of the unfamiliar.  

Nature 
- inherently novel, making exteriorization easier. Such novelty, such as born of nature’s vastness and silence, can encourage introspection and self-reflection.  

- Defamiliarization/Stability: If we’re distracted from our inner turmoil, we can anchor a relatively stable and unchanging space, observar a stable form amid the turmoil, which forests a sense of calm and perspective.  The calmness can be a catalyst for internal exploration, our own struggles and seeking paths towards internal growth and resilience.

- goodness: The inherent beauty of a tree – its elegant form, its vibrant colors, its resilience – can offer a source of inspiration and hope, reminding us of the world's inherent goodness and balance.

- Meaningful: Trees have symbolic meaning across cultures and time.  They imply growth, strength, wisdom, and even immortality.  They can also offer personal meaning based on our personal history that can bring solace, or if not, the universal meaning can be used to bring perspective. associated with universisal meaning, altering out interior meaning

- Inspiration: The beauty of the other can remind us of our own innate beauty and resilience, empowering us to face our challenges with renewed strength and clarity.

Homes 
- inherently familiar; however, through techniques of defamiliarization (focusing on specific details, like the sunlight dancing on furniture or the intricate patterns of wallpaper, can reveal hidden beauty), we can change this.  
- The familiar could offer the stability and security to create a focused internal space.  
- Homes are filled with personal and artificial objects, are associated with personalized meaning and sentiment.  Beloved spaces can evoke positive emotions and offer a sense of comfort and belonging.
- Homes can be cluttered with the remnants of daily life. 

A home can already direct one towards introspection. 

Intersubjecitivty - the intersection between people’s cognitive perspectives.  The way a person is influenced by the culture, family and friends that surround us.  Who we interact with impact the way we interact with the world.  Our culture can influence our values and behaviors.  

Husserl - the interchange of thoughts and feelings between two subjects as facilitated by empathy.  
Subjectivity - the perception or experience of reality from one’s own perspective and necessarily limited by the boundary r horizon of one’s own world view.  

Intersexuality - the shaping o fa text’s meaning by another text, either though deliberate strategies such as quotation, allusion, plagiarism, translation, pastiche, or parody  or by interconnections between similiar or related workers perceptved by audience these references can be deliberate or not.  The effect is not always intentional.  It is inadvertent.  Meaning is not transferrred from write to reader directly but is mediated through, or filtered by, codes imparted to the writer and reader by other texts.  We read a book, we decode it as part of a movement, a kind of work, as part of a conversation, etc.
