# Space


Can have curves that further bend in the presence of objects, vast dimensions curled up into very small scales, contains textures and other such properties.   It could have their own form of energy and momentum, and it interacts with matter and energy. 

When we talk about space, we’re not talking about the temperature, pressure, density, and flow, and exists as a consequence of gravity and other planetary conditions.  

Not a specific material or substance like air, but rathe the entire framework within whihc everything exists.  And has its own independent properties, like geometry, topology. 

Air is a thing within space.  

We can image in space as water, air, or even something more exiotic.  How would objects move through it differently.  How might its properties influence their interactions.  

If space has a different curve, dimension, or topological structure, how would movement and existence be affected in these spaces, how would you sense it.  

If space were a characeter or played a significant role, what would be its properties, its interaction with objects, and how it might feel or behave. 

If we were to create a visual or a sound scape of space, what would its textures, colors shapes, or be like.  
See how hard it is to move in different terrrains - consider how a medium itself mgiht function as a skin of terrain that encourage or impinge movement, thinking, feeling, being.  

Experiment with different postures and movements, noticing how space interacts with your body and senses.

You're correct! My previous response oversimplified Edward Feser's view on space and the presence of a medium. He indeed proposes a more nuanced position than simply dismissing space as nothing or an empty void.

Here's a more accurate breakdown of his views:

**Feser does not believe space is an empty void but rather a relational medium with properties.** He criticizes the idea of space as a complete emptiness, arguing that such a notion leads to problems like infinite divisibility and action at a distance.

Instead, he proposes a **relational view of space**, similar to Aristotle and Aquinas, where space arises from the relationships and interactions between material bodies. However, he goes beyond the classical view by attributing certain **properties to this spatial medium**:

* **Potentiality for motion:** Feser argues that space allows for the possibility of material bodies to move, occupy positions, and exert forces upon each other. This potentiality for motion is inherent in the nature of space itself.
* **Structure and order:** He contends that the interactions between bodies and their motions influence the structure and order of space. This influence isn't a one-way street; the structure of space also affects how bodies move and behave.
* **Causality and change:** Space, according to Feser, isn't static but can be affected by the dynamics of moving bodies. He suggests that changes in the motions and configurations of bodies can cause corresponding changes in the spatial medium itself.

**However, it's important to differentiate Feser's "medium" from how it might be conceived in physics.** He emphasizes that his idea isn't meant to be identical to scientific models of fields or forces like the electromagnetic field. His primary focus is on the philosophical and metaphysical implications of space, not necessarily proposing a specific physical mechanism.

* **Videos:** "What is Matter?" with Prof. Edward Feser, "The Metaphysics of the Will" with Prof. Edward Feser

Remember, Feser's views are open to interpretation and debate. Engaging with his work and the broader philosophical discussions about space can provide a deeper understanding of this complex topic.
