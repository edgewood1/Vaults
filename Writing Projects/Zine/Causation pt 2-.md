# Causation pt 2.


Move this to causation word

**The process of becoming as 4 aspects / causes**

Efficient cause: the actors/actions involved in change; eg, as an acorn becomes an oak, sunlight, soil, water are involved in the process of germination, growth.

Final cause: the goal towards which it grows, guiding the efficient cause: reproduction, growth/thirving, contributing to the ecosystem.

Material cause is that which it is composed of: organic molecules, water, minerals (potencies).

Formal cause is how these elements are organized into cells and tissues.  (Isn’t this part o the process of germination/growth?)

Do i have a 5 ways part? 

**The Five Ways (move to p. 25?)**
1. Change: If everything is a sequence of influenced movements, there must exist an uninfluenced movement.  As pure actuality, it enables the actualization of things. 
2. Existence: If all is fleeting existence, there must be permanent existence.  As pure existence, it facilitates the existence of things.
3. If all is a web of dependencies, there must be something that stands independently.
4. If all is a pursuit of goodness, there must be an underlying good. Being the embodiment of goodness, it provides the world with an objective to pursue.
5. If all is characterized by order and complexity, there must exist an underlying intelligence.  As infinitely complex and orderly in its actions, it represents infinite intelligence, embracing knowledge and truth.
