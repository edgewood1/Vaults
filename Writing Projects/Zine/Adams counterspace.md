# Adams counterspace


The concept of counter-space is discused by Rudolf Steiner and geometrically characterized by George Adams. In this context, counterspace is described as a space where objects exist simultaneously in both regular space and counterspace, experiencing strain and stress as they cannot always conform to the laws of both spaces simultaneously.

The central idea presented is that in counterspace, familiar concepts from ordinary space, such as parallel planes, do not apply in the same way. Instead of parallel planes, there are parallel points. The discussion also touches upon the notions of 'inside' and 'outside' in counterspace, using the example of a sphere. Unlike in ordinary Euclidean space, where the inside is the region enclosed by the surface, counterspace introduces a different perspective where the inside is what is outside from a spatial viewpoint.

The passage further explores the application of counterspace to understanding life, particularly in relation to living organisms. It suggests a metric linkage between space and counterspace and discusses the role of surfaces, such as membranes, in living organisms. The concept of synergy is introduced, emphasizing that every cell contains all others, making the entire organism an interconnected whole. The mathematical idea of fractals is employed to explain the population of counterspace infinitudes, providing a way to understand the complex structure of organisms.

The passage concludes by mentioning the relation between radial displacements in counterspace and time, while tangential ones concern frequency and rhythm. It hints at the idea that cosmic forms invert into what is conventionally thought of as atomic structure, challenging the materialistic underpinning of atoms and suggesting a connection between the life ether and the genesis of living forms.

In summary, this application of counterspace goes beyond its use in non-Euclidean geometries and explores its potential role in understanding the interconnectedness of living organisms, emphasizing the dynamic relationships between space and counterspace.

The alternative definition of counterspace, as presented in the passage, is distinct from its application in non-Euclidean geometries. In this context, counterspace is conceived as a space where objects exist simultaneously in both regular space and counterspace, facing strain and stress due to the challenge of conforming to the laws of both spaces. While this definition is not explicitly linked to the quantum world, some parallels may be drawn, considering the unconventional nature of quantum phenomena.

Let's delve into the unclear parts:

1. **Parallel Planes vs. Points:**
   - In regular space, parallel planes are familiar concepts. However, in counterspace, the passage suggests that parallel points exist instead. This implies a departure from the usual spatial relationships, introducing a different geometric perspective.

2. **Inside vs. Outside in Counterspace:**
   - The passage uses the example of a sphere to illustrate the difference between ordinary space and counterspace. In ordinary space, the inside is the region enclosed by the surface. In counterspace, the inside is what is spatially considered outside. This plays with the notion of enclosure and infinity in counterspace.

3. **Role of Surfaces and Synergy:**
   - Surfaces, particularly membranes, are highlighted as important in understanding life in counterspace. The passage suggests that if aspects of the life ether manifest through surfaces, it solves the problem of the seemingly rigid quality of fully metric transformations. Synergy is introduced as the remarkable cooperation of all cells within an organism, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the whole.

4. **Counterspace Infinitudes:**
   - The concept of counterspace infinitudes refers to a population of such entities. Each infinitude is considered an image in ordinary space of a single primal counterspace. The mathematical idea of fractals is employed to explain how distinct but related transformations can interwork, leading to a more organic synergy.

5. **Radial Displacements vs. Tangential Ones:**
   - Radial displacements in counterspace are related to time, while tangential ones concern frequency and rhythm. This introduces a dynamic aspect, suggesting that the unfolding of primal counterspace into space involves both radial growth and tangential spatial rhythms.

In summary, this alternative application of counterspace explores a dynamic and interconnected understanding of space, challenging conventional geometric concepts and emphasizing the role of counterspace in explaining the complexities of life and organisms. It provides a unique perspective that goes beyond traditional geometries and delves into the relationships between different dimensions and the phenomena they govern.


In the context of the described counterspace, the concept is presented as a departure from conventional spatial understanding, introducing unconventional ideas:

1. **Parallel Planes:**
   - The passage suggests that in counterspace, parallel planes, a common concept in regular space, are replaced by parallel points. This challenges our typical geometric understanding and implies a fundamental difference in spatial relationships.

2. **Inside vs. Outside in Counterspace:**
   - When discussing a sphere in counterspace, the inside is described as what is spatially considered outside in ordinary space. This concept challenges traditional notions of interior and exterior, introducing a unique perspective on spatial relationships.

3. **Sphere Inside-Out:**
   - The idea of a sphere being inside-out refers to the unconventional nature of counterspace, where the typical understanding of a sphere's inside (enclosed region) corresponds to what is considered spatially outside.

4. **Enclosure and Infinity:**
   - In ordinary space, enclosure is described concerning a point-wise way of thinking. Points that cannot be moved to infinity without crossing the surface are considered "enclosed." This notion challenges traditional geometric thinking by bringing infinity into the concept of enclosure.

5. **Surface and Life Ether:**
   - The passage hints that surfaces, particularly membranes, are significant in understanding life in counterspace. It suggests that if aspects of the life ether manifest through surfaces, it may resolve the apparent rigidity problem of fully metric transformations.

6. **Counterspace Infinitude and Reflection:**
   - Counterspace infinitudes are described as populations, and each infinitude is considered an image in ordinary space of a single primal counterspace. The concept involves reflections of ordinary objects in counterspace, introducing a unique way to perceive and understand the relationships between spaces.

In summary, the terminology and concepts presented challenge traditional geometric thinking, introducing a novel perspective on spatial relationships, enclosure, and the manifestation of life forces. The idea of counterspace seems to serve as a theoretical framework to explore unconventional aspects of reality beyond typical geometric and spatial conventions.
