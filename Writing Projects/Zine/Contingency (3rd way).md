# Contingency (3rd way)


Contingency (3rd way)

Each member in this chain is dependent on another. All members of our world are dependent creatures.  But can all members be dependent? There must be a necessary / independent creature to initiate / maintain the chain. 

Motion: All that is in motion must be moved by something else. This cannot go on forever, so there must be a first mover, which Aquinas identifies as God. (Gives it actuality)  This has to do with a thing realizing its potential. 

Possibility (contingency pt2: 3rd way)

None of these items are necessary - they are highly dependent on a host of other items.  This chain of dependent elements could rattle on forever, but at some point, they require a necessary agent that initiates. 

Possibility and necessity.  All things are merely possible - they don’t have to be the case.  For their being the case, they rely on a necessary case.  Things don’t have to be present, but they are as a  result of something that has to be present. 

Essential per se - necessary for effect, but occurs simultanousely
Subordinate essential - necessary for effect, but occurs later in time
Accidental - not necessary for effect to occur, and so can be removed, ie, the color of the tree. 

Cause

Argument Set II

Gradations of goodness. (4th way)

There are degrees of goodness in the world, and these must have been caused by that which is absolutely good.   There are best and better things and these are mediated by goodness, which is the ultimate form of goodness and the criteria by which we can just things as good, better, best. 

All things have a good associated with them.  Each thing strives to achieve its good.  This good binds together all of a kind: so two kinds of food have an “ideal food” that binds them.

There are good things and better things, depending to what extent a thing might achieve its good.

The goodness of a concrete thing, such as a tree, is a reflection of the goodness of abstract things, like life, beauty (beauty reflects god’s godness) , order (part of an ordered system seen as a reflection fo god), usefulness, relationship (tree a symbol of our relation to god).

Abstract goods mediate between concrete goods and goodness itself.    Goodness is a perfection of god’s nature, which it shares with all creation as a source.  Goodness, as a transcendental object, is a quality found in all things, including god.   

All things are ordered to god as the highest good and ultimate end of all things, 

Everything is inclined to seek out its own good, and that this good is ultimately found in god.  

Are concrete goods instances of abstract goods, which are instances of god?

Knowledge

All people desire what they perceieve as good, such as food or health.

We seek to know the good of food, because then we know which foods are better for us.    

This good allows us to judge a thing's goodness - whether it is good, better, or best.  It gives us an object-focus for our desire, but also serves as a pointer toward god, which is reconciliation of all such ideals.  

AND it informs the very composition of the thing itself, being not abstractions, but animating principles endowing with potentials.

When we learn about the world, we increase the likelihood of learn a particular thing’s good, as well as the associated abstract goods, and goodness itself.  We grow closer to the real.  We better see it.

Through the tree, we can learn about the ideal, and the world as a whole.

It’s challenging to learn the good, however, because we have an imperfect and limited perception and understanding of the good or ultimate reality.  

This is why we pursue things that are not so good for us.  

Our knowledge is reflected in our truth statements.  If these reflect reality, they are considered true.  The more  refined the statements, the better they reflect reality.   If knowledge is more closely aligned to reality, it is considered more valuable. 

We increase our knowledge through study and inquiry.

By increasing knowledge, we refine our perception and grow closer to the nature of reality. 

We know and better see the ultimate good, which leads to greater fulfillment and peace. 

Karma: When I act, i imprint an aspect of myself into the world.  It is absorbed, observed.  Later, it is projected back.

Faith is a kind of perception:  Faithfulness is marked by one’s ability to clearly see and engage with the absolute; (reality)

the farther i am from reality, the less clearly i see it, the less faithful;.  Thus, as distances increase, faith becomes a struggle and assume a range of degrees, sending entities down divergent paths (mistaken for the good? But enabling diversity?)

The argument from design. This argument states that the order and complexity of the universe are evidence of a intelligence.

**From beggining**

Who am I?

My humanity defines me as a rational animal.  My soul defines me as a unique instance of human, with all its potentials and attributes that is given to the body in order to interact with the world.  My soul is unchanging eternal abstract potential. 

Where the soul meets the body, and by extension the world, is born the personality.  My personality is what I and others most easily see; it resides in my acts, words, thoughts, feelings, imagination.  My personality can evolve, unlike my soul.  

The world has inscribed itself into my personality, informing how I see myself and the world.  How do I adjust these forms? We might gain insight into how to improve a habit, but whether we enforce practices to cultivate the new habits. 

One habitual mode of seeing is the assuming the bias of the scientist:  The world, despite seeming to be outside and apart from me, nevertheless possesses aspects of me, and bends my vision of you.   In seeing you, I adopt the bias of the scientist.  

If I refuse to learn anything about the tree, I will likely gloss over the tree, refer to it as insignificant.  Due to my projection of apathy, I will not see or learn much.  The  tree senses my imposition, and it pushes back.  

My imposition and neglect inadvertently thwarts your will to find yourself.  Much as I am the product of the world and my soul, so are you, and since my apathy is a part of the world that molds you, my apathy, and the negativity it entails, only reduces you.  

However, if I learn to notice you, and learn about you, I might see you in another way.  If I see you as a creature of depth as profound as myself, I might see and learn something new.

Parts of a body/soul

A guiding protective spirit, intelligence, soul, ideal (considered as a secondary substance).   The oak soul.  A guiding spirit is an instance of a primary substance, which is its genus (the human / plant soul).  

What is the soul? 
Oak soul exists as a completed being in an alternate dimension
It intersects with the material world.  Material: environmental factors include the time / space of birth & growth + the genes that help define shape, size, look of the body, health.  
What does the soul contribute? It acts as a catalyst, stirring material and energy into the sprouting and growth of the seed.  it pushes the tree to achieve its ideal, regardless of its material circumstances, to become. Soul could be responsible for the tree’s resilience and ability to adapt to its environment.  Its ability to communicate with other trees and the natural world and form community.  It is sentient.  It is responsible for the tree’s ongoing growth and reproductive abilities. 

Projection is born of this meeting

From this meeting,  the physical tree is born and grows. 
Alongside this physicality there grows a personality, which is the soul’s instantiation within the tree
This ideal projects itself upon the world even as the world responds in kind. 
From the meeting of the ideal and the world (cells / setting) arises the physical tree.  From this extended relationship, a personality arises.

Resistance 

The tree as world/tree both resists and relents to the impositions of the soul.
In the resistances, we see its unique aspects, those unrealized aspects of the ideal, ones that reflect your time and place, ones that have never before been realized. 

Observation is born of this meeting
 
Besides projecting itself upon the world/tree, it also observes how this tree unfolds, and in observing, it learns about the world and itself. 
 The soul can only experience the world through the body, and the body is an extension of the world. 
The world is continuously projecting itself into the space of the tree, and always observing the result.
Through the body, the soul has a view of the world, adn teh personality is the result.  The soul can observe both, even as it projects itself upon the body-world.  
Through the body, it learns about the world, and 
learns about itself.  The tree is the fruit of this learning.   .
The tree is born of perception of its ideal meeting the world.  
In being perceived, we become.
