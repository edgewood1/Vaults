God is truth. Source of all principle

If we don’t have that in out lives we seek out totalitarian ideologies

Bc we need a totalizing vision either man made or juman

We can’t know details of truth but we can know it exists and this is humility

We know we can’t live up to it and yet it helps us by being present and this is love

We run from it bc of shame and refusal to accept gods love. Or ignorance if it

Instead we seek out totalitarian ideologies that define us to our contentment and coddles us.  It won’t challenge. 

To seek god is to seek truth is to question one’s stance continually and to learn to live in negative capability
