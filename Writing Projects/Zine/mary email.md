In terms of meditation, the “east” describes the 3 highest stages as: 
- ordinary consciousness - debilitated by the flow and departures around time
- dharana - concentrated inwardness such that one is mostly in flow that pursues most objects that unfold around us; an analogy could be made to animal consciousness.  Wild animals are alert to everything around them.
- Dyana - extended concentration such one remains in flow but is not easily moved by surrounding objects; if the analogy could be made to plant consciousness, a plant “seems” less alert and mostly continuously directed towards its source of light, air, and nutrition.  It typically is continously being fed.  
- samadhi - union - that transcends flow / departure
