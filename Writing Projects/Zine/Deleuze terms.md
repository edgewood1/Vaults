Assemblage 
- a dynamic node  
- contains interconnected parts
- Can be any entity - a person, object, thought, desire

Assemblage -a  complex system of interacting parts shaped by flows of energy, matter, and information. This constant flux leads to the breakdown of existing order ("deterritorialization") and the creation of new ones ("reterritorialization"), resulting in ever-evolving "bio-spiritual formations."

Lines of desire
- when a person experiences another, the effect they impose via their memory, needs, knowledge, acts,

Lines of flight
- when a person acts in a way that the world’s perception of the object is changed.  (Renovating a house)
- Here, we question fixed connections

Desiring-production
- The ways an object has of affecting us
- A house conveys comfort, security, status
- This arises from the way people have talked about the house, or acted in such a way to contribute to house’s setup.  
- Various desires contribute to the creation of a thing (assemblge) which affects us. 

As this process unfolds, new nodes are added and old ones revised.
