<u>**Existence**</u> 

What is the difference between a tree and the conditions that allow it to exist? Asking about such conditions leads us to explore the relationship between cause and effect, and in this case, there are two kinds of causes: those that bring things into being (temporal) and those that sustain existence (atemporal).  

In the case of the tree, the seed it grew from, and the parents who created the seed, are the causes of its coming into being.  

However, the soil, sunlight, and air are causes that sustain its existence.  

Of these sustaining (atemporal) causes, there are two kinds: the soil, sunlight, air, and even the universe that supports the tree are all contingent.   They once did not exist and could one day fall out of existence.  

But what are they contingent upon?  What is the foundation that sustains even the universe itself? The answer lies in that which is non-contingent - “being” itself.

So we can say that all things participate in being itself; being is the great equalizer, the ultimate ground of all being.  From the smallest particle to the vast cosmos, everything shares in this fundamental act of existing.

**Division 1: material / immateral**

Existing things can be divided into two categories: material and immaterial.

Considering material things, the tree I see before me is an example, as are the earth beneath my feet, the animals I hear rustling in the distance, and the sky above. 

My ideas and memories of the tree would constitute immaterial things. Were I to study the tree, the equations I would use to calculate its height, the sensations I might experience, the information I might gather, and even the laws of physics I might employ would be included in this category. This category also includes spiritual beings, such as angels, demons, and souls.

**Division 2: Substance + Properties** 

We can think about existing things in terms of substances and properties. Substances exist in themselves, like the tree standing before us. While a tree depends on things like sunlight and water for sustenance, its primary dependence is on existence itself. Substances include a wide array of things: rocks, trees, animals, people, and even spirits.

Properties, on the other hand, cannot exist independently. They depend on substances for their very being. The color red, for instance, cannot exist without a red object, and an idea cannot exist without a mind to hold it.

Just as properties inhere in substances, our understanding of substances is also mediated through their properties. We can only know a leaf, for example, through its color, size, shape, and function. Properties are how substances are revealed to us.

**Substances have two kinds of properties.**  

Some properties are essential to a substance, defining its very nature. A tree, for instance, can be defined by essential properties like being rooted, living, and having a woody stem that utilizes photosynthesis. If these properties disappear—if the tree dies, the stem disintegrates, and photosynthesis ceases—it undergoes a substantial change and is no longer a tree.

However, these properties are ultimately based on our generalizations and observations. The essence itself, the "treeness" that makes a tree a tree, remains inaccessible to direct observation. To express this, we often refer to essences through varying levels of generality: "treeness," "plantness," and even "being," indicating a hierarchy of essences that connect the individual to broader categories of existence.

**Accidental Properties**

Non-essential properties are those that can change without affecting the fundamental nature of its substance.  These properties can be sensual, like the changing color or size of leaves, or the can describe relationships, like the tree’s position in the landscape.  Even changes in our ideas about the tree, or its relationships to other trees, don’t change the fact that it remains a tree.  

Each of these properties can still offer valuable information about the tree.   They reveal aspects of its life cycle, its interaction with the environment, and its significance to us. 

**Potential vs Properties.**

We possess the potential to learn, just as a tree's leaves possess the potential to change color. When we learn, we gain knowledge, and when a leaf changes color, it manifests a new property. While our capacity for learning and the tree's capacity for colorful leaves generally persist throughout our lifetimes, the actualization of these potentials—our knowledge and the leaf's colors—changes regularly, undergoing cycles of transformation.

**Immaterial actualization**

A stone's chemical composition gives rise to its properties like density, color, and hardness. These properties represent the stone's potential for interaction and change. If its chemical composition were to change radically, the stone itself would cease to exist as that kind of stone.

Living things are more complex. While they possess a material layer, they also have immaterial aspects: vegetative (growth and nutrition), sensitive (sensation and perception), and rational (intellect and will). A sleeping person, for example, actualizes their mineral and vegetative aspects, while their sensitive and rational aspects remain potential

Spirit beings, on the other hand, are more like stones in the sense that they only have one aspect.  Just like stones only have their mineral composition, spirits only have their intellectual-volitional acts.  In the same way that a rock’s existence is tied to its chemical composition, a spirit’s existence never cease to unfold ideas, concepts, and other such activity.  

While both spirits and humans possess cognitive abilities, humans must mediate their understanding through matter. Spirits, being immaterial, bypass this limitation. Consequently, they can develop deeper and more advanced knowledge than humans, grasping concepts and truths directly without relying on sensory input

**Division 3: Substances as Parts and Wholes**

Material things, like a tree, are composed of matter and form. Form is the organizing principle that gives the matter its structure and function.

Matter, in this case, refers to the parts that make up the tree. We can identify these parts at different levels of scale: branches, trunk, and leaves; or cells, molecules, atoms, and even subatomic particles. 

This matter we perceive, however, is secondary to an underlying primary matter. Primary matter is pure potentiality, the capacity to be anything at all. It is the common thread that connects all things, both material and immaterial.

**Part Whole: division** 

A part cannot exist without its whole, just as matter cannot exist without form. When a branch is part of a living tree, it shares in the tree's form, participating in its life, growth, and nourishment.

However, a branch separated from the tree loses its connection to that form. It no longer functions as a branch, receiving nutrients and contributing to the tree's life. Instead, it will decay, becoming merely a piece of wood.

While the matter of the branch persists, the form that made it a *branch*—a functioning part of the living tree—is lost. Its existence as a branch depends on its connection to the whole.

Interestingly, a fallen branch can take on new forms of existence. If a branch falls and the tree later disintegrates, the branch ceases to be a proper part of the tree and becomes a substance in its own right, albeit with a different form reflecting its new state as a fallen branch.

If someone finds it and artificially preserves it, the branch transitions from a natural object to an artifact, imbued with cultural or historical significance.

Taking this a step further, if the preserved branch is incorporated into an art project, it might lose its individual substancehood and become an accident of the new entity, the artwork.  

<u>**Levels of matter**</u>

While the branch is a part of the tree, it can also be considered a whole in itself, with its own form that organizes the matter of its cells. 

This creates a hierarchy of form and matter: the tree has its overall form (treeness), and the branches, trunk, roots, etc., are part of its matter; the branch has its own form (branchness), and the cells are its matter; the cells themselves have their own form (cellness), and the molecules and organelles within them are their matter.

Therefore, the branch is not just matter for the tree, but also a form that organizes its own matter. It exists as a substance in its own right, even though it is also part of a larger substance

<u>**More than the sum**</u>

This whole is both the sum of its parts, as reflected in the tree's overall weight, and more than the sum of its parts, giving rise to emergent properties like shade, fruit production, and photosynthesis, which are not possessed by any individual part.

**Immateriality.**

Immaterial substances, however, are not organized in terms of parts and whole, form and matter because they lack matter.  There is no division or composition within an immaterial substance; it exists as a unified whole, its form being its essence.

**Division 6: Essence and form:** 

Each existing thing is a composite of essence and form. 

Essence is the intelligible blueprint of a thing, defining its nature and potential for existence. This blueprint connects the individual to broader categories culminating in the divine essence of "being." For example, an oak tree's essence encompasses "oakness," "treeness," and "plantness," culminating in its participation in "being."  

The hierarchical structure of essence is mirrored in a thing’s physical structure (like a tree and its parts) and even its ecological relationships, like those involved between the tree and its environment. All forms are grounded in and dependent on the divine idea of "being".

Form is the actualizing principle that brings the potential of essence into existence. In material substances, this actualization occurs through matter, creating a distinction between essence and form. Essence contains degrees of generality, while form is a specific instance of that generality. For example, the essence of "dog" can be actualized in many individual dogs, each reflecting the essence but with unique characteristics due to the influence of matter.

In immaterial beings, however, form perfectly reflects essence due to the absence of matter. There is no potential for multiple instantiations. This makes each angel radically unique, possessing a form identical to its essence. Each angel is a singular expression of God's creative power, not merely an instance of a shared essence like humans.

**On the nature of existence**

There can only be one essence of existence, as multiple essences would limit each other, contradicting the concept of unlimited being. This singular essence of existence is God, the unique, self-existent being.  As the only self-actualizing being, God is the creator of all else.

God, as pure actuality, possesses fully actualized knowledge, goodness, truth, and beauty. All the perfections we observe in the world are reflections of these divine attributes. Essences exist in God, not as separate beings, but as distinct facets of His infinite perfection.

God's activity is a single, eternal, unchanging act of creation. All things, including essences, forms, and substances, participate in this act and depend on it for their existence. We are, in essence, the ongoing actualization of God's eternal knowledge.

Appendix

**Terms**

Substance - combination of form + matter experience through the senses.

Matter - principle of potentiality, individuation, limitation, and change

Form -  principle of actualization; actualizes essence; experienced through the mind.  In immaterial objects, form is not constrained by matter, so it perfectly reflects essence.  in material objects, due to individuating effects of matter; it doesn’t perfectly reflect essence.

Essence - metaphysical principle; underlies matter/form (or form in immaterial).  Contains various levels of generality.  It is actualized by form, and in the case of material beings, individuated in material beings


**Division 5: Substances as Environment Subject**

While both the tree and the branch can be considered substances in a broad sense, the branch is more accurately described as a proper part of the tree. This means it is a constituent of the tree, essential to its structure and function, but it cannot exist independently as that same part without the tree.

In contrast, the relationship between a tree and the Earth is different. The Earth is not a whole of which the tree is a part. Rather, the Earth provides the environment or conditions for the tree's existence. 

This difference is evident in several ways. 

First, while a branch is essential to the structure and function of a tree, a tree can lose some branches and still be a tree. The Earth, on the other hand, can exist without trees, although it would be significantly different. 

Second, a branch originates and develops as part of the tree, whereas a tree originates from a seed and develops as an independent organism within the environment of the Earth. 

Finally, the influence between a branch and a tree is primarily one-way, with the tree providing structure and resources to the branch. The influence between a tree and the Earth is more reciprocal, with the tree affecting the Earth's atmosphere, soil, and ecosystem.

**After**

While branches are important for a tree's functioning, a tree can lose some branches and still exist as a tree. Removing all branches would likely kill the tree, but it doesn't change the fundamental nature of the tree as a substance. 

Regarding the tree's place in a larger context, it's true that a tree is dependent on the Earth for its existence. However, this is not a strict part-whole relationship. The tree depends on the Earth, but it's not a constituent part of the Earth in the same way a branch is a constituent part of the tree.

Unlike abstract concepts, spirit beings possess personhood, agency, and a specific role within a theological hierarchy.
