# Strickland


- broke down my desk; now work around the house, like on the couch; and in coffeeshop one afternoon / week; sitting at my desk has contributed to back  and hamstring issues and likely negatively affects my breathing
- Started daily yoga practice, and twists + inversions, help with my core flexibility, and my diet. 
- Tried to measure sugar intake through levels app.  We found that sugar in blood doesn’t take a leap until afternoon, and then it doesn’t have a negative effect.  My light morning meals result in a minimum increase. 
- I still lay down in the afternoon but usually result in 20 minute of rest rather than passing out, which only now happens when due to increase in diet/exercise the 1-2 days prior.

Current issues
- should not watch videos mid-day, especially after resting.  How to replace this? Contemplating my work? Violin or guitar? Journal freewrite? 
- Should not drink coffee mid afternoon - instead: electrolyte water? Maybe a caffeine pill instead. 
- Haven’t been doing b12 but should make it a monthly activity
- Currently my issue is just overeating and hydration.
