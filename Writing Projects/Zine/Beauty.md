# Beauty


What is true beauty does not change and affects all men in the same way.   It is changeless unlike the incessantly changing things of existence.  

Said another way what is true beauty but the potential for every man to be moved towards the good if even momentarily and that is the definition of the changeless an aspect of which resides in ourselves.  

When we say we don’t believe in god what are we saying? That we are materialists.  That we don’t believe or can’t commit in a particular relationship where one is comfortable in both knowing the other and admiting the other is above you or continuously alludes yr knowledge.  

God is ourselves what we desire what we know.
