# When we

Act from no idea we are driven and hence determined is enslaved

When we act from a formed concept ie an idea we are free

When our idea is a want Ie an apparent t good we are freely do evil

When it is a real good Ie a need we are freely good

A real good is general and essential and necessary for humans

We eat and hydrate sleep exercise mind and body commune and create.  

That said anything is good.
