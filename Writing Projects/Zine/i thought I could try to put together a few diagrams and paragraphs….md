i thought I could try to put together a few diagrams and paragraphs.

Before I try, these are some of the ideas I think they have in common:  

- non-living matter (as in the gasses that make up the air and even the spaces that such gas fills) is agentive.  
- the great chain of being arranges matter + life into a continuum of kingdoms.
- All the kingdoms exhibit a particular state of consciousness + mode of perception
- The mineral kingdom establishes the conditions for both life and concepts, result is the formless unitary.
- the plant kingdom enables growth-life + concept, the result is the world of archetypes
- the animal kingdom activates an restless pursuit of the good + truth, the result is the real
- the human enables this trajectory to reflect upon itself, and the teh result is the symbolic
- the universe, through this pursuit, strives to come to terms, strives  towards that which it is a reflection of. 
In coming to terms with itself, it engages in the ceaselessly novel behavior that is diverse expression, self-knowledge, and knowledge of the universe  s

Do you have any issues with these views? 





Three aspects
Matter = “outside”
Mind = “inside”
God = the initial mover of matter and mind because
1. If matter and mind exist, it has either always existed,
2. It was brought into eoxisitence. or was created by the one or the other, and if it was mind that created matter, than what created mind? 
God =not a thing, but what is other than thing; in which case it is a non-thing, and yet it exists, it is existing no-thing, ie, existence itself. 

God is immaterial, ie not matter, so if we were to align the 3: God > immaterial > material
This formula suggests idealism: that consciousness informs matter primarily and is informed secondarily. 
If matter consists of 4 states (earth, air, water, plasma), then by analogy, the immaterial must consist of 4 states.  
The Hindus define these 4 states as the transcendent (God), the boundless, the world of form, and the world of flux. 
But
4 states of matter exists on a single dimension, whereas the immaterial is composed of many dimensions (as opposed to states) each of which might contain states.

The physical (the states) contains 4 kingdoms of nature.  
The immaterial (its states) contain 4 hierarchies of spirit. 

Each kingdom has a radically different state of conscious.  All have one. 

Each is also built on the other forming a spectrum. Stone is pure matter.  Plant is animated matter.  Animal is mobile animated matter.   Humanity is symbol-composing mobile. animated matter. 

We could continue this into the immaterial domains.  Flux form formlessness. 

Traditional view
Matter = “outside” 
consciousness as immateriality = “inside”




However, 

The contradiction
The problem with this is that our outside also has consciousness.  Particles floating in space, and space itself, as well as the sense of time all “have” consciousness or are motivated by consciousness. 

If all is consciousness, could we say
- material substance = condensed consciousness
- immaterial substance = uncondensed consciousness or subtle matter 

Materialism says immaterial is an epiphenomenon (or side-effect) of matter, lacking its own locus of truth.  
- this implies that consciousness is determined by chemical reactions and that we lack any freedom (not true)
- This implies that the body can affect consciousness, but not vice-versa (not true)
- matter is itself an epiphenomenon of subatomic dynamics, and yet matter is as much a source of its own truth ad the subatomic. 

Idealism says that consciousness precedes the thing that is observed. 
- we can say that our consciousness directs our bodies and even chemical reactions
- Is it possible that matter is an epiphenomenon of consciousness? No. 
- Is consciousness express itself as matter? 

Consider: 
1. Heat (energy / lacks mass / it not matter / immaterial)
2. Cools to gas

By consciousness, we mean awareness, which is an immaterial process. 
It’s often depicted a property of matter.  So a bug has consciousness. 
But what about the idea that consciousness “has” a bug? Or consciousness expresses itself as a bug.  The bug as an expression of consciousness. 

When we meditate on our “inner” life, we perceive its contents as belonging to us and private - limited to our distinct bodies.  Others cannot perceive them due to the space-time barrier 

While we do have such consciousness-bodies, these bodies are located in an immaterial / consciousness landscape (or sea).  Much like our physical bodies are located in physical landscapes. 

And much like our physical landscape is populated with creatures, so is this immaterial landscape

Many of these creatures are responsible for the thoughts we experience, many of which are reflections of creaturely emissions. 

Furthermore, why juxtapose material + immaterial lanscapes as contrary? Couldn’t we talk about varying degrees of immateriality; that is various landscapes where more subltle landscapes underlie less subtle ones?  

Most people  have cultivated a mode of perception that is focused on the physical, so we non-physical entities or their landscape.   We only percieve their effects within the organism that is our subtle body. 

However, animals do percieve this.  

We could juxtapose human and animal: 

- humans are symbol-making animals .  
- but symbols can be ambiguous, multi-meaning, mistaken for what they symbolized, or poorly percieved. 
- animals lack sybmolic gestures, but possess a clarity of perception. 

We can enter into an altered state of consciousness, cultivate a unique mode of perception that is analogous to animal-perception.  This is called “clairvoyance” or clear-seeing.

The animal serves a vital purpose.  It is the bedrock enabling symbol making.  And symbolization has the purpose of the universe self-expression.  

To illustrate, look at the minieral - plant arising. 

What is teh relation between symbolization and self-reflection?

How is the animal foundational for reason.  Wouldn’t it make sense for animals to become human?

As a physical analogy, we need mineral world to exist so that a plant world can grow.  In two senses: 
- plants are composed of minerality + etheric
- plants require consumption and production of minerality

but animals are not composed of plants, but they do contain an etheric body.  
And for one creature to build on an etheric body, another creature must maintain the ehteric body uncultivate, and another must exist without one. 
plant world has an etheric without an incarnated astral body
in a sense, this is the presence of the etheric in teh physical 
thees etheric bodies constitute the etheric landscape upon which the animal grows and adds to. 

1. close eyes and see an astral body
2. set an astral landscape
3. see etheric landscape
4. see physical landscape

The plant scape upon which we stand is the foundation upon which animals and

Mineral kingdom connects us to archai
Plant to archangels
Animals to angels.   A world of energy. 
We constitute a mirror.  To this world we are pure matter upon which they rest. 

Angels live in. World of pure objects. 

1 see real objects
2 see their agents
3 see their context. Mineral world connects us here

Mineral is de opted to law
With more life.  Creatures strive to move dither away towards expression and knowing.  Itself.  

A scale stretch

Turn towards k
Communion with k in trust
Thru k to Christ. 
Thru Christ to the world. 


From essence of man whose arose as image of god.  

At some stage mineral arose as ego   Thus occurs in an immaterial substance known as formless whose intelligences give rise to such entities as mineral ego and spirits who tend to it.  This rise the result of intelligence striving for self knowledge.  Perception give rise to denser substance that reflects its rays.  But this denser substance becomes aspects of what it reflected. 

This have wise to its next stage where ground set  for its its astral and plant ego.  Next of mineral ether 

During the Saturn state, warmth substance permeated.  

During Sun, some of these entitites were enlived with air, while others were not
1. not - stablized
2. were - experimental growth, not possible without a stable framework

Consider water being given shape due to a bowls solid frame, or more exact, a bowl requiring a table, floor, or hands to sit stable (otherwise it would drift in space)

Pattern

During Moon, some of the experimental further developed while others supported such a journey.

Consider a colony of people who are wishing a party off to explore a distant planet, hoping they might come back with news regarding the ir salvation; Consider a country who must fight a war in order to preserve their country, and how some men go to fight while others remain behind to support the war effort.  A principle of the universe is diversification, and this is that. 

The continual change of mineral substances in man's present body could not take place until the mineral realm had taken shape;

. Then there really took place a kind of cleavage of the human body. This cleavage came about through densification; not until a mineral kingdom had been separated out as it is today could the present human body arise, representing a single sex. The Earth and the human body had first to be solidified to the mineral nature as we know 

What he does tell us quite dramatically is that human beings came first -- they appeared earliest in the stages of the evolution of our cosmos through the working of beings higher in the hierarchy of spirits than we humans are today. This tells us, by the way, that we humans will one day be able to create other living beings when we have evolved to the stage where these hierarchies exist. If humans came first, then animals, plants, and even minerals must somehow be derivatives or by-products of human evolution. In other words, instead of "humans evolving from animals" as Darwinians would have us accept, Steiner tells us -- shows us in great detail -- how "animals devolved from humans.
