**Informal statement of the argument: stage 2**

There are two main types of causal chains: linear (or accidental) and hierarchical (or essential). In *linear chains*, each cause simply transmits causal power from the preceding cause, like a row of dominoes. One domino falls because the one before it pushed it, and so on. In this scenario, an infinite regress isn't a problem, as each event is fully explained by the prior one. The dependence here is purely *temporal*—one event happens before the next, and causal power is passed along.

*Hierarchical chains*, on the other hand, are different. Here, each cause depends on a higher cause for its continued existence and causal power *at this very moment*. A classic example is a hand moving a stone with a stick. The stone’s movement depends on the stick, and the stick’s movement depends on the hand. The stick doesn't have its own independent power to move the stone; it's constantly receiving that power from the hand. This is a crucial distinction: in hierarchical chains, causes and effects exist simultaneously, with lower causes *participating* in the causal power of a higher cause, not merely transmitting it. This dependence is *ontological*—one entity depends on another for its very being and operation at this moment. Without an ultimate source of this power, nothing in the chain can act. Other examples include a puppet and its puppeteer, a lightbulb and its power source, an orchestra and its conductor, and a computer program and the computer running it.

This brings us to the interplay of accidental and essential causation. While accidental causes explain *how* a specific event occurs in a particular way (like one billiard ball hitting another), they always presuppose an underlying *essential* causal structure that makes those accidental interactions possible. Accidental causes operate within a framework of laws of nature, physical properties, and the very existence of the objects involved. These underlying conditions—like the existence of the billiard balls, the laws of physics governing their motion, and even the existence of space and time—are not explained by the accidental collision itself. Instead, the essential causes, ultimately tracing back to the Unmoved Mover (or God), ground this framework. They explain *why* there are laws of nature, *why* there are physical objects with specific properties, and *why* there is existence at all. Because accidental causes always presuppose these essential causes, there can be no purely accidental series independent of essential causation. Every accidental chain is ultimately dependent on the essential causal structure that sustains it. Thus, accidental causes provide *proximate* explanations (how something happened in this specific instance), while essential causes provide *ultimate* explanations (why there is something rather than nothing). It's not that every accidental event has a uniquely associated essential cause, but rather that the essential causes provide the overall framework within which all accidental events occur. This distinction is even relevant to the problem of evil; Feser argues that God, as the essential cause, allows for accidental events (including suffering) as part of an ultimately good universal order.

This leads us to the Unmoved Mover. Because the Unmoved Mover is purely actual, lacking any potentiality, it is the necessary foundation for hierarchical causal chains. A linear chain can regress infinitely, but a hierarchical chain requires something that can initiate change without itself being changed. This is where the concept of pure actuality becomes crucial. A purely actual being, having no potentiality, has no possibility of becoming anything other than what it already is. There is no potential to be actualized, no capacity for change. Therefore, it *must* be immutable. Just as a perfectly round ball has no potential to become "more round," a purely actual being has no potential for further actualization. This immutability implies other attributes: existing outside of time (eternal), being non-physical (immaterial), and being maximally perfect. Furthermore, there can only be one such purely actual being (unity), as any difference between multiple beings would imply some degree of potentiality or privation. Because it is the source of all actuality, it must also be all-powerful (omnipotent) and perfectly good.

Finally, we consider the Unmoved Mover's intelligence. Intelligence involves grasping abstract concepts, combining them into thoughts, and drawing inferences. Feser emphasizes the principle of proportionate causality: whatever exists in an effect must somehow pre-exist in the cause. Since the Unmoved Mover causes all possible things with all possible forms, these forms must pre-exist within it in a universal and abstract way. This capacity to hold forms abstractly *is* intelligence. The effects exist in the Unmoved Mover as ideas pre-exist in the minds of creators. Therefore, the Unmoved Mover, as the intelligent cause of everything, is necessarily all-knowing (omniscient), as nothing can exist outside its "thoughts."

<u>**Part two**</u> 

Because the Unmoved Mover is purely actual, lacking any potentiality.  
Why? A linear chain can regress infinitely (), but a hierarchical chain () requires an object that can initiate change without itself being changed.   

But how does self-initiated change equate with pure actuality
- something that is *purely actual*, with no potentiality whatsoever. By definition, there is no possibility for it to become anything other than what it already is. There is no potential to be actualized, no capacity for change. Therefore, it *must* be immutable.  A ball that is perfectly round has no potential for it to become more round because it’s already at maximum roundness.  It has no potential for further actualization in terms of roundness.  
- existing outside of time (eternal), 
- non-physical (immaterial), 
- maximally perfect. 

Furthermore, there can only be one such purely actual being (unity), as any difference between multiple beings would imply some degree of potentiality or privation. 

Because it is the source of all actuality, it must also be all-powerful (omnipotent) and perfectly good.

The argument then turns to the crucial attribute of intelligence. Feser explains that intelligence involves the capacity to grasp abstract concepts, combine them into thoughts, and draw inferences. He emphasizes the principle of proportionate causality: whatever exists in an effect must somehow pre-exist in the cause. Since the Unmoved Mover causes all possible things with all possible forms, these forms must pre-exist within it in a universal and abstract way. This ability to hold forms abstractly is precisely what constitutes intelligence. The effects exist in the Unmoved Mover as ideas pre-exist in the minds of creators. Finally, the Unmoved Mover, as the intelligent cause of everything, is necessarily all-knowing (omniscient), as nothing can exist outside its "thoughts."
