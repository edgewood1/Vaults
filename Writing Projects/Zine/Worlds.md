There are two kinds of substances.  Material and immaterial.   

Both substances appear as either an object or landscape.  Object and landscape are relative terms.

A tree sits on a field, a field sits within a mountain range.  In these two examples, the field initially acts as landscape (or context) and then as object (or text).

A tree is an example of an object composed of material substance.

A thought is an example of an object composed of immaterial substance.  Other examples of immaterial objects include images, emotions, impulses.

Just as a tree can grow within a field, a thought can grow within an emotional state or within an ideology, which is a framework of thoughts.

Matter has mass and and volume (occupies space); immateriality does not; however, it can influence matter.  

Energy is used in science to describe how much potential a physical system has to change. In physics, energy is a property of matter. It can be transferred between objects, and converted in form. It cannot be created or destroyed.

Matter can contain energy, but it can also exist in fields of energy (landscapes).

There are 4 states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, plasma. 

Immaterial substances are are more subtle than its denser counterpart.

Immateriality, like energy, has no mass / volume.   But thoughts can contain their own energy / force.  Impulse and emotion contain more energy, than some thoughts, some thoughts contain more energy than others.  

Energy and force

A force is a push or a pull.  It is measured in Newtons.

Energy is measured in Joules.  

If I apply force to a cart, the cart accelerates forward.  
If I apply force to cart, I transfer/convert energy chemical energy in the body to kinetic energy of the cart.  
Likewise, I could apply force to a cart, and expend doing so in the effort, but because of strong counterforces, the cart does not move, work is not expended, but energy is expended as the muscles must maintain their effort.  chemical potential energy will be converted into internal thermal energy, which is released to the environment

Energy is the potential to exert force.

All magic, including sorcery, is the putting into practice of this: that the subtle rules the dense—force, matter; consciousness, force; and the

superconscious or divine, consciousness. It is this latter rulership that the Empress symbolises. Her crown, sceptre and shield (coat-of-arms) are the three instruments of the exercise of this power. The crowned head indicates the power of the Divine over consciousness; the right arm (according to the viewer of the Card), which bears a sceptre topped by a cross mounted on a globe of gold, represents the power of consciousness over force; and the left arm, which carries a shield bearing an eagle, signifies the power of energy over matter or the volatile over the gross.


These bodies occur across landscapes

Bodies appear as if from nothing and diss appear as quickly.  They also impact the physical. Much like the physical Can impact it

This tendency of materialization means that either they are invoked by us and appear from nothing or they have a life and history and surface from other dimensions.  

The [brane multiverse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology) version postulates that our entire universe exists on a membrane ([brane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane)) which floats in a higher dimension or "bulk". In this bulk, there are other membranes with their own universes. These universes can interact with one another

The [holographic multiverse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can encode the contents of the volume of the region.

Quotes about infinite depthe

Tomberg describesThe Magician therefore represents the state of concentration without effort, i.e. the state of consciousness where the centre directing the will has “descended” (in reality it is elevated) from the brain to the rhythmic system, where the “oscillations of the mental substance” are reduced to silence and to rest, no longer hindering concentration.
Concentration without effort—that is to say where there is nothing to suppress and where contemplation becomes as natural as breathing and the beating of the heart—is the state of consciousness (i.e. thought, imagination, feeling and will) of perfect calm, accompanied by the complete relaxation of the nerves and the muscles of the body. It is the profound silence of desires, of preoccupations, of the imagination, of the memory and of discursive thought. One may say that the entire being becomes like the surface of calm water, reflecting the immense presence of the starry sky and its indescribable harmony. And the waters are deep, they are so deep! And the silence grows, ever increasing...what silence! Its growth takes place through regular waves which pass, one after the other, through your being; one wave of silence followed by another wave of more profound silence, then again a wave of still more profound silence...Have you ever drunk silence? If in the affirmative, you know what concentration without effort is.
