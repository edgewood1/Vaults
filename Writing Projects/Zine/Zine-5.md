Angels consist of potency and act

I can write a novel but am currently not

If I were to write one it would have a life of its own despite my definitions

We could call such life born of Angelic potency elementals or ether. 

God also create prime matter and substantial forms

Elemental enable prime matter to be molded by form and enable them to materialize and maintain their materialization.  

Elementals and particles.
