In Aquinas's hylomorphism, the primary focus is on the union of form and matter to create a substance. 

However, the concept of form having its own form, leading to a chain-like structure, is more aligned with Neoplatonic ideas and certain esoteric traditions, including Steiner's cosmology.

**Plant Form as a Higher Form:** 
The specific "tree form" that shapes an individual tree could itself be a manifestation of a more general "plant form." (ability to photosynthesize, grow, and reproduce).

This could lead to a hierarchy or chain of forms, where each level informs and shapes the level below it:  Life form -> Plant form -> Tree form -> Oak form -> Specific physical oak

**How it Works**
This hierarchical structure of forms suggests a process of emanation or unfolding, where the more abstract and universal forms give rise to increasingly specific and concrete forms. 

Each level in the chain embodies a certain degree of potentiality, which is actualized and further differentiated in the level below it.

* **Life Form:** This represents the most fundamental principle of life itself, the animating force that distinguishes living beings from non-living matter.
* **Plant Form:** This form embodies the specific characteristics and potentials of the plant kingdom, such as photosynthesis, growth patterns, and reproductive strategies.
* **Tree Form:** This further refines the plant form, adding characteristics specific to trees, such as the development of woody stems, branches, and leaves.
* **Oak Form:** This further specifies the tree form, adding the unique qualities and potentials of oak trees, such as their longevity, strength, and acorn production.
* **Specific Physical Oak:** This is the final, concrete manifestation of the oak form, shaped by its individual genetics, environment, and experiences.

**Conclusion**
The chain suggests that even seemingly simple forms, like a tree, are connected to a deeper and more complex network of archetypal principles that guide their development and expression. 

This perspective enriches our understanding of the relationship between the abstract and the concrete.

**Problems with the Chain of Forms**

1. **Are there** an infinite number of intermediate forms between the life form and the tree form? Where does this chain ends and does it lead to an infinite regress of forms? Answer: It's possible to propose a finite number of levels within the hierarchy. This could be based on significant leaps in complexity or the emergence of new capabilities, such as the transition from inanimate to animate forms or the development of consciousness.
3. **If there are** potentially infinite number of forms, where do we draw the boundaries and distinctions between each level?  **Answer:** Instead of relying solely on subtle gradations, the boundaries between forms could be defined based on their functional roles and characteristics. For example, the "plant form" could be distinguished by its ability to photosynthesize, while the "tree form" could be defined by its woody structure and growth patterns.
7. **Why would so many sub-forms be necessary? Isn’t it** inefficient and cumbersome?  Why not just have general and specific form?   Human and individual? Mineral and individual? That would create 4 general forms for everything.  And if so, could we posit 4 general forms for the immaterial? And then, why 4? And why does the 4 begin with 1?  **Answer**: While complexity is inherent in the natural world, the principle of parsimony (Occam's Razor) suggests that simpler explanations are generally preferable. Therefore, the chain of forms should be as complex as necessary to explain the diversity of life but not overly complex to the point of becoming unwieldy. 
11. Does the chain continue to grow in density, leading to even more concrete and specific forms? Or is there a "turnaround" point where the forms become less dense and more abstract, perhaps leading back towards the spiritual realm?  
12. **Answer:** Instead of a linear progression, the chain of forms might represent a cycle of emanation and return, where the concrete eventually dissolves back into the abstract, completing the cycle of manifestation.

**Part 2

1. The Problem of Infinite Regress**
* **The Challenge:** If we allow for intermediate forms between any two levels (like "plant" and "tree"), we open the door to an infinite regress of forms. This could lead to an unwieldy and potentially meaningless system where distinctions between forms become blurred.
* **Possible Resolutions:****Finite Levels:** Even with intermediate forms, we can propose a finite number of significant levels within the hierarchy. These levels could be defined by major leaps in complexity or the emergence of new capabilities (e.g., inanimate to animate, non-conscious to conscious).
	* **Functional Distinctions:** Instead of relying solely on subtle gradations, we can differentiate forms based on their distinct functions and roles within the overall system.
* Aquinas, following Aristotle, was wary of infinite regress in causal explanations. He believed that there must be a First Cause (God) to avoid an endless chain of causes.   
* In the context of forms, he might argue for a 
* **finite hierarchy of essential forms**, perhaps corresponding to the major categories of being (e.g., inanimate, plant, animal, human).
* Intermediate forms between these major categories might be seen as accidental variations within the essential form, not separate forms in themselves. This limits the potential for infinite regress.
**2. The Question of Density**
* **The Challenge:** Does the chain of forms continue to increase in density after reaching the physical manifestation, or is there a "turning point" where it shifts towards lesser density and a return to the abstract?
* **Possible Resolutions:****Cyclical Model:** A cyclical model of emanation and return could address this. The physical manifestation could be seen as a midpoint in the cycle, with subsequent stages involving a gradual refinement and spiritualization of the form, ultimately leading back to the source.
	* **Transcendence and Immanence:** The chain of forms could be seen as a continuous interplay between transcendence (moving towards greater abstraction) and immanence (moving towards greater concretion). The physical manifestation would be a point of maximum immanence, but the potential for transcendence would always be present within the form.
* **Density of Forms**
* Aquinas primarily focused on the 
* **actualization of form in matter**, not on a continuous increase in density. The form, for him, is the principle that gives matter its specific actuality and defines its potential.   
* He might view the "chain of forms" metaphorically, as a way to understand the different levels of perfection and complexity in creation, rather than a literal increase in density.
* The question of a "turnaround" point after the physical form might be addressed through the concept of the soul's potential for immortality and its return to God after death.
**3. The Role of Individuality**
* **The Challenge:** How does individual variation and uniqueness fit within this hierarchical structure of forms? If all oaks share the same "oak form," how do we account for the differences between individual oak trees?
* **Possible Resolutions:****Individualizing Principle:** Alongside the hierarchy of forms, there could be an individualizing principle that accounts for the unique characteristics of each being. This could be attributed to factors like genetics, environment, and even the individual's own choices and experiences.
	* **Dynamic Interaction:** The forms themselves could be seen as dynamic and interactive, adapting and responding to their specific contexts. This would allow for individual variation within the overarching framework of the form.
**Individuality**
* Aquinas recognized the importance of individuality, even within shared species or forms. He attributed this to the **principle of individuation**, which he identified as **matter**.
* While all oaks share the same essential form ("oakness"), the specific matter each oak is composed of makes it unique. This accounts for the variations in size, shape, and other accidental qualities.
* He might also acknowledge the role of accidental forms in contributing to individuality. These are non-essential qualities that can vary within a species, further differentiating individuals.   
**In Summary**
While Aquinas didn't explicitly address the "chain of forms" concept, his philosophy provides resources for addressing the challenges you've raised. He might emphasize a finite hierarchy of essential forms, focus on the actualization of form in matter rather than increasing density, and attribute individuality to the principle of individuation (matter) and accidental forms.
It's important to remember that Aquinas' primary concern was understanding the relationship between form and matter in concrete substances, not elaborating a detailed cosmology of interconnected forms. However, his philosophical framework can be creatively engaged with to explore these more nuanced questions about the nature of forms and the unfolding of creation.
