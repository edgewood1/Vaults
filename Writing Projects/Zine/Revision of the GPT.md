# Revision of the GPT

Certainly, let's align the three applications of awareness with the soul faculties of thinking, feeling, and doing:

1. **Thinking (Intellect): Learning**
   - Learning involves cognitive processes, reflecting the intellectual faculty of thinking. It's about understanding, analyzing, and assimilating information.

2. **Feeling (Emotion): Problem-solving**
   - Problem-solving often involves emotional intelligence and understanding the impact of decisions on oneself and others. It aligns with the emotional aspect of feeling.

3. **Doing (Will): Adaptability**
   - Adaptability, the application of awareness in response to changes, can be seen as the execution of decisions based on one's will. It involves intentional actions and aligns with the faculty of doing.

In this way, the three applications align with the cognitive, emotional, and volitional aspects of human experience, mapping onto thinking, feeling, and doing respectively. Awareness, as the overarching concept, encompasses and facilitates these applications.

Triads

The prevalence of the threefold nature in various conceptual frameworks, such as those you mentioned, is often rooted in the human tendency to seek patterns, symmetry, and comprehensiveness in understanding the world. Here are some reasons why the threefold nature is recurrent:

1. **Completeness and Balance:** Three is often seen as the smallest number that allows for a sense of completeness and balance. It provides enough diversity to capture complexity while maintaining a simplicity that is easy to comprehend.

2. **Dynamic Interaction:** Triads naturally suggest dynamic interaction and relationships. Each element can have a distinct role or quality, and their combination leads to a more comprehensive understanding of a concept or system.

3. **Cognitive Ease:** Humans tend to find patterns and structures that are easy to remember and process. The threefold nature offers a level of cognitive ease, making it more memorable and accessible in various cultural and intellectual contexts.

4. **Symbolic Significance:** Throughout history, certain numbers, including three, have held symbolic significance in various cultures and belief systems. The trinity, for example, has deep religious and philosophical connotations, contributing to its prevalence.

5. **Holistic Representation:** A threefold division often allows for a holistic representation of a concept. In the examples you provided, thinking, feeling, and doing represent a comprehensive view of the soul's relation to the world.

It's important to note that the recurrence of the threefold nature is not universal, and different cultures or systems may employ different numerical divisions based on their unique perspectives and needs.


2. Analogies and Interpretations: The Divine Trinity
Many cultures conceive of the divine as a unified entity existing in three distinct aspects. This conception correlates with our experience of ourselves being a single awareness manifesting as the diverse faculties of thought, feeling, and action. 
Consider the single awareness with three faculties: 
thinking, which extracts forms (knowledge) from the world;
Feeling - our response to form  based on past experiences.   It is born of thinking and leads towards willing; thus it synthesizes the two.
Will/doing - purposeful action based on thinking and feeling.  Or is this the synthesis?
Similarly, the divine Godhead is often depicted as awareness  encompassing three persons: 
the Father - absolute knowledge
the Son - purposeful action (will) realized via incarnation and redemption.
Holy Spirit -absolute love, which synthesizes knowledge and will.  .
Numbers, too, hold profound meaning in this context.  While we often use numbers as a means of measuring, they initially had a qualitative dimension, related to their inherent characteristics, relationship
One:  unity, singularity, and the source from which all creation arises. 
Two: duality, the interplay of opposites, and the actualization of creation. The will in contrast to the form.
Three: creativity, expansion, and the harmonious unfolding of the creative forces.  The synthesizing element.

1. Time: the network of nodes, Past states (some of the nodes have differed) and Future states (some of the nodes will differ in light of past difference)

Numerology / meaning of numbers

1- the number of balance, completeness 
2- the coming together of diverse elements to form a whole.
3- The synthesis of opposing forces to bring something new.  

Divine

If we are defined by this three-fold nature, and we are made in the image of the creator, then we can assume 
- the creator  possesses a three-fold aspect, even if just as a part of its imagination; 
- These qualities exist in a transcendent state.  In doing so, we recognize the limited nature of our imagination and the transcendent nature of the divine. 

What is intelligence? 
- We understand intelligence as the complex of (1) awareness: the ability to influence and be influenced (2)  adaptability - responsive to changes in environ (3) Problem-solving - ability to navigate probabilistic outcomes and engage in quantum interactions to achieve states of minimal energy or stability.
- This is a form of “network interactions” where 2 and 3 are interdependent. 
- We understand this faculty as immaterial. 
- As immaterial, it can be embodied (as in our case) or not.
- As a disembodied intelligence, it can be identical to its existence or not. 

** what is the difference between adaptability and problem solving. 

We could analogicallly attribute these qualities to immaterial and divine intellgiences.  

In various traditions, the divine is realized as a unity of 3 aspects.  It is 1 thing, but it is 3. 

Soul - one awareness, implying unity, and three faculties, being diverse aspects or functions within this unity.
thinks / extracts forms. (Solving)
Feels / communes (adapting)
Doing/Will? But what is will outside of hte material? (Learning)
awareness (unity)


** but in my original map awareness in the combination.  
God - one godhead, implying unity, and three persons, distinct facets or roles within the unity. 
Analogical level only.  

**Numbers**

Numbers are not merely quantitative symbols but carry profound qualitiative meanings.  Numbers are not merely symbols for quantities but reflections of deeper cosmic principles.  Each number enables the unfolding of a unique shape and pattern, which enables a stream of symbols / significance. 
1- unity, singularity, independence, origin, center, unmanifest., essence from which all originates.  The power of creation and realization. Pure potentiality before any manifestation. 
2- duality, the interaction fo opposites.  The High Priestess.  The complementaryity and polarity inherent in creation. The actualizing of creation.  
3- creativity, expansion, relationship assumes its own form, balancing, the two points, creating the first shape.  Harmony / synthesis.  Teh Empress. The result of the interaction of harmonious.  The harmonious unfolding of creative forces. The unfolding of ice that enables the creation to experience and with it, its relationship to the creator, the one. 

**Different frameworks**

Three nodes can be arranged in a number of ways: one could lead to another in a sequential or cyclical manner.  Two could be composed of one. One could be composed of infinitely repeating self-similar patterns of 2 and 3 (or 1, 2, and 3) at varying scales (fractal).  One could lead lead to 2 properties and 3 phenomenon via timer actions (emergent properties).  Dialectical: 1 clashes with 2 antithesis resuliting in synthesis 3.  Spiral: 1 leads to spiral progressions of stages 2 and 3.

**Divine**

In various traditions, god is realized as the unity of 3 aspects.
Much like our own identity, born of a single awareness and multiple aspects, the divine might be cast as awareness / existenceitself unfolding as
Father: Divine Omniscience (Perfect Knowledge) - a manner of knowing an retaining.  Knowledge exerts an attractive force (like gravity), which is als restricting.
Son: Choice / Will - a manner of willing / doing - Divine providence, representing guidance and governance, overseeing and directing the course of human history toward the ultimate purpose of incarnation, redemption and salvation.  Will is a repulsive force, pushing outward, encouraging freedom, movement, and expansion. Seeks joy.   
Holy Spirit  Love - that which binds and communicates between these two aspects, facilitating wisdom/ understanding / revelation of divine truths.  

**Grace / etheric**

Source of radial energy - the etheric / born of various ethers: there are 4 - one for each hierarchy?  Ether reflects the unification of the godhead and its potential to bring forth multiplicity.  Ether is the substance of love?
Love is a force that provides insights into values and connections.  Thus, love can express a form of knowledge. This form of knowledge is associated with wisdom / understanding that goes beyond intellectual comprehension, encompassing emotional and  relational dimensions - an appreciation of the uniqueness and diversity of others 
analogically speaking, the etheric might be depicted as a domain or region of space that has none of the attributes of space as we know it.  We might depict it as a space or dimension that contains landscapes and beings of endless sorts. 
In reality, however, this space would not have any of the attributes of space as we experience it three-dimensionally.  It would be like trying to imagine time as extending in more than two directions (past - future) and space in more than three (height, width, length). 
Thus, we could call this regions “counter-space”
Counter-space reaches a kind of limit in the space of our dimension, complementing and interacting with it, leading to effects that differ from those observed within space alone. Excitations or disturbances in fields within space had counterparts or mirrored effects in counter-space. 

**Counterspace and the etheric**

The volume of the universe is permeated by energy fields, whose intensity is variably distributed.
The most fundamental field is an energetic layer which forms the shell of counterspace. 
Counterspace is an inverse, parallel universe 
where time flows in a non-linear multi-dimensional manner, 
antiparticles are more stable and dominant, 
the microscopic manifests as macroscopic, 
consciousness is a fundamental force, shaping reality based on collective thoughts and intentions of its inhabitants, 
celestial bodies, such as stars and planets, possess consciousness or life, 
the universe itself is conscious entity influencing the behavior of its components, 
beings exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously, interacting with realities beyond our comprehension, 
life forms possessing radically different biology, being energy-based, parallel histories exist here.
Counterspace is seperated from space via the membrane of the energetic / quantum field. 
Counterspace can excite this field, leading to the creation of particles that carry force (bosons) -  some of which become material particles that experience force(fermions (quarks/eletrons)).
Those field-regions where bosons dominates is called space.  Those regions where material particles dominate is called matter.  
The presence of matter exerts an effect on the gravitational field, the curvature of spacetime.  If the mass of the object is sufficient, its presence will direct force towards it, helping to hold the object together, creating a suction that attracts less dense objects from nearby regions. 
Too much gravity can crush an object, while too little can cause it to disintegrate. 
Besides regular matter, we have dark matter, which is present in space.  Thus, there’s two kinds of space: dark and non-dark matter.  This has its own suction power,  alleviating pressures on surrounding objects. 

Larger nearby objects or dark energy can further relieve pressures by creating additional space.
Force from counter-space is called ether.  Teilhard called it radial / psychic energy associated with the etheric / consciousness.  This is expressed as the inner lining of things.  Thsi energy tends towards increasing (chemical and psychic) complexity and centricity, centricity reaching a collective point of convergence at the end of the world, a tendency to survive material bodies in humans, but in animals, its reabsorbed into the tangential.  
It parallels tangential / material energy associated with the visible.  This is expressed in the outer lining of things.  Examples include force of gravity, electro-magnetism. 
Ether causes the membrane to vibrate, producing particles.  
Further, ether can colonize these particles, upon which these particles assume a heightened degree of awareness.  The more colonized, the greater the degree of awareness.  If the etheric influence is strong, the particles are alive, but this influence inevitably wanes. leading to the dispersion of matter, including the sleeping ones. 

Story

Reality is composed of material and psychic objects and forces.  Its condition for being is the trans-object. 

Thus, we have our first three-fold system: trans-object, and its psychic and material unfolding. 
Intelligence is awareness with a tendency towards navigating outcomes to achieve stability and responsible to its environment (how are these different?)

Through analogical imposing, we can assume the trans-object as well as our won space is threefold. 
Unlike the trans- and material, the psychic has each of its tree parts unfold as three parts. 
A design where each part of a three-part whole is itself composed of three parts, mirroring the whole, is referred to as a “nested” or “recursive” structure.  It exhibits a self-similarity across different scales, creating a pattern that repeats itself in a hierarchical fashion.  It is a self-replicating / self-scaling pattern, where the structure at each level resembles the structure of the whole. 
This is the layer of possibility / potentiality whereas the material is the layer of actuality, which is reflected in the material-mind.  It reflects the multi-verse, or the stage between the absolute and the actual.

What holds true for the supernal triad also holds for its three aspects, but the reverse isn't necessarily accurate. Grace is the outward manifestation of this triad, combining expansive and attractive qualities—a reflection of God's self-giving love, bringing all into existence. Described as undeserved favor, God's grace is freely given and unearned.
Considering God as both an internal and outward reflection, Earth becomes the object of divine knowledge, and the hierarchies represent the relationships between. The material three kingdoms mirror the immaterial persons, and the hierarchical relationship, akin to a sign's components, involves internality—comprising the signifier (e.g., a name), the signified (mental image), and the referent (actual entity).

In the analogy of maps—world, mind, tree, and tree maps—each reflects aspects of creation. God and matter are colonized by life, demonstrating the interconnected relationships within this complex framework.
