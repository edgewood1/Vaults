# Aristotle on place


PLACE 

Space is not an infinite void

It the “place” within a finite spherical universe.

Each objects has its purpose and natural place, determined by its inherent properties.   This purpose and place contribute to the harmonious cosmic order.  (Science doesn’t explain purpose of objects within the vastness of space).  Stars revolve around one another in perfect circles, fire naturally rises towards the heave, while the earth always seeks the center.  If you drop a stone, it falls toward the Earth because that’s its natural place.  It doesn’t just move through empty space, it seeks its proper position within the universe. 

NON-EMPTINESS

Space is not empty, but filled with ether, the medium for motion and supported celestial objects

Different regions of space have different qualities like coldness or hotness, influencing how objects moved within them. 

For example, a feather falling through the air might encounter varying levels of resistance depending on temperature and heaviness of surrounding ether, affecting its descent compared to a heavier object.

MOTION

Motion and space are inextricalby linked.  Objects don’t move through “empty space”, movement occurs in relation to something else already occupying space.  That something else could be another object, the surrounding ether, or even the object itself it it was rotating or expanding. 

For example, a projectile thrown into the air doesn’t move through a  vacuum, it displaces the surrounding air, creating a wake and a pushing against the ether it encounters.  This interaction with the medium is essential for its sustained motion.  

FESER’S POINTS

POTENCY AND ACTUALITY

An object has the potential for certain movements or transformations, which become actualized through interaction with other objects or the surrounding environment.  For example, a seed has the potential to become a plant, but this potentiality can only be actualized through the interaction of factors like sunlight, water, and nutrients.  Similarly, a stone at rest has the potential to move downwards, which is actualized when dropped or pushed. 

FINAL CAUSALITY

Objects have inherent tendencies towards their natural ends, their goals or purposes.  An objects idea forever strives towards the end (or is attracted towards this end, despite the limitations posed by its place).  Fire’s tendency to rise up is its final cause, seeking its proper place within the hierarchy.  This does negate the effiecient cause (combustion releasing heat), but adds another layer of explanation.
