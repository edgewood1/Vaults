Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the Angelic
Orders? And even if one were to suddenly
take me to its heart, I would vanish into its
stronger existence. For beauty is nothing but
the beginning of terror, that we are still able to bear,
and we revere it so, because it calmly disdains
to destroy us. Every Angel is terror.
And so I hold myself back and swallow the cry
of a darkened sobbing.

Are demons that shadow-self of angels? 
Angels cast off an aspect of themselves, which fall down to the earth.

Humans are animals (and plants, and minerals) that have cast off an aspect of themselves.  In order to achieve symbolic-thinking, they had to leave behind certain qualities that define (limit) animals, plants, and minerals.  In this sense, the earth is the shadow of humanity, and the earth is a reflection of humanity. 

Aquinas - evil is merely the lack / deprivation of goodness (there is no such thing as evil itself).    In this sense, all creatures and all acts harbor the potential for goodness. 

Nietzsche - there’s neither good or evil except in what we project.  Christian morality is slave morality that values weakness, humility and meekness while denigrating strength power and individuality.  It suppresses human potential and creativity.

Can’t we assume both master and slave morality simultaneously, giving power to god, and meekness to ourselves to be moved by this power? Isn’t this the means of channeling creativity? If we are on top of the hierarchy, it is to serve what is below us.
