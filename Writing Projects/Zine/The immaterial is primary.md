# The immaterial is primary

# 

1. there are two primary substances in the universe: material and immaterial
2. Objects are made of either material or immaterial substance
3. An idea is an example of an immaterial object.


1. Material objects are known for their potential for change, 
2. For such an object to change, it must be moved by moving (actualized) object outside it. 
3. The classic example: a still billard ball is moved when a moving one hits it. 


1. A common counterpoint: but I can move myself**A contingency**
3.  is a proposition that is neither true under every possible [valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)) (i.e. [tautologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic))) nor false under every possible valuation (i.e. [contradictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction))
10. If I will myself to move, it is not true that I will always move.
11. I must have a lack of restraints, I must have the energy and concentration to move, I must have a healthy nervous system.


1. If a material object must be moved by a moving external object, which is itself moved by a similiar object, ad infinitum, we would have an infinite regression and have not identified an actual cause. 
2. A first cause would have to be a mover who is not itself moved. 
3. Such a force would possess no potentiality because it is fully realized. 
4. Because every material object can be potentially moved, such a force would have to be immaterial.
5. thus immateriality is the basis for materiality.  

The immaterial contains entities
1. Material substance composes a landscape and objects. 
2. We could say the same about the composition of immaterial substance
3. When observing our inner life, we percieve immaterial forms. 
4. These forms are no static, but productive of other forms, and seeming consume other forms
5. forms are living entities?
6. Concepts also have landscapes in which they can exist - ideologies or frameworks for thinking. 

The immaterial is multi-dimensional
1. The immaterial world may be divided into at least 3 dimensions / aspects
2. the immaterial as immediately accessed by embodied beings
3. the immaterial as accessed by non-embodied beings
4. the immaterial as fully realized. 

The material can exist as one of 4 possible “states”
1. Solids can melt into liquids, and liquids freeze into solids.
2. Liquids can evaporate into gas, and gas can condense into liquids.
3. Gas can transform into plasma?

Analogy to … 
Immaterial force “condenses” into matter, creating the mineral realm, whose consciousness is that of trance, possessing a minimal perception of the material world, but a profound perception and even devotion of the immaterial.  In the material, such an object would possess form and attractive/repulsive force.  The nature of this force depends on the form, which depends upon the mode of condensing.  

Likewise, the immaterial can exist in various states.
1. Waking
2. Sleeping
3. Dreaming
4. Trance

Difference between angels and human
1. Humans require reason, angels can use intuition
2. Humans err, angels have clear knowledge
3. Humans require sense perception, angels do not. 

 Matter
- states of matter compose
- Kingdoms of nature consist of
- Differing States of conscious
- 2 levels of states.  Humans can exp 4 states which are analogous to those of other kingdoms but actually within the human
- If matter is the condensation of consciousness.  It’s not because a great intrusion doesn’t occur as a greater I tenacity of consciousness but it’s reverse.  A more subtle.  Which means a reversal?
- ————————————————————————

- The immaterial is primary; governing the material
- The material is expressed (condensed) immateriality, much like an act is an expressed thought or impulse (an act of consciousness)
- While we can talk about the distinction, we could also say they exist on a spectrum. The material can be marked by degrees of immateriality.   
- Eg, air is more immaterial than solids.  Angels are more material than god. 
- If we define the material as that percieved by physical senses and the immaterial defined by intellect, then there is a distinction.  
- But also, a perception is often accompanied by a concept. 
- What is the relation between the immaterial, the intellect, and consciousness? 
- Consciousness means awareness of physical and  conceptual objects.  Awareness, like the intellect, is an immaterial faculty bc it can perceive immaterial objects.  
- As function of immaterialities dominance is its ability to perceive the immaterial and materail 
And yet, air is quite material since it can be experience by the physical senses.  

If air is an immaterial analog, solid is composed of air?

But “true” immateriality is not experienced by the physical senses, and yet it permeates, experiences, and governs the physical.  

In terms of degrees of immaterial, immaterial beings are said to be material compared to god. They are composed of “immaterial substance”.  

Materiality is associated with potentiality, and intelligence is actuality that contains potentiality, and the divine is considered pure potentiality.  

There is more than one kind of immateriality.  
 
Like the material, the immaterial consists of objects (like ideas or images) and settings (like ideologies or emotional states). 
Like in the material, we can talk about different kinds of objects / settings.
The immaterial contains:
- dimensions (is this a kind of landscapes)
- Entities 
The material contains
- one dimension
- Many landscapes + entities 
The material / immaterial co-exist along a spectrum where matter is condensed immateriality.  
Immateriality is synonymous with consciousness, and there exists various states of consciousness.  
Condensed > less condensed > least condensed (most actualized).  
Physical > astral / Arupa / rupa > transcendental.
The immaterial contains entities
- Elementals
- Spirits
- Angels
- Souls
- Embodied souls
The material can exist as one of 4 possible “states”
- one environment moving through 4 states
Likewise, the immaterial can exist in various states.
Angels and humans - immaterial states.

Big Bang model: Initially, the universe was permeated only by energy. Some of this energy congealed into particles, which assembled into light atoms like hydrogen and helium. These atoms clumped first into galaxies, then stars, inside whose fiery furnaces all the other elements were forged.

Inflation is an extremely powerful theory, and yet we still have no idea what caused inflation — or whether it is even the correct theory

In [ancient philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_philosophy), any attenuated "thin" matter such as [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air), [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)), [fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire) or [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) was considered incorporeal.[4] The ancient Greeks believed [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element)), as opposed to solid [earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element)), to be incorporeal, in so far as it is less resistant to movement; and the ancient Persians believed [fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element)) to be incorporeal in that every soul was said to be produced from it.[5] In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.

is said that [angels](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01476d.htm), compared to [God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm), are material and corporeal, not, however, as if anything corporeal [existed](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm) in them

Incorporeal creatures exist bc God is incorporeal, and he intends creation to be good and strive for his goodness, imitates him, god creates by his intellect and while, hence for creation to strive for him, he must use intellect and will, and intellect isn’t action of a body, which is limited to "here" and "now." Hence the perfection of the [universe](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15183a.htm) requires the [existence](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm) of an incorporeal creature.
