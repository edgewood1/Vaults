Thomas Aquinas's philosophical framework, specifically his theory of matter and form and substantial form, provides a basis for understanding how the elemental properties, like those traditionally ascribed to fire, earth, water, and air, are present within and contribute to the characteristics of composite substances. Aquinas argues that these elemental forms are not merely physical constituents, but rather play a role in the substance's essence and capabilities, even though they are not fully realized or present as separate entities within the composite.

In essence, Aquinas's theory of matter and form, and his understanding of the elements, provides a framework for explaining how the properties of the four elements contribute to the nature and qualities of more complex substances, even though they are not physically present as distinct entities within the mixture

While Thomas Aquinas, a prominent Christian theologian, didn't explicitly discuss salamanders, gnomes, or elemental beings in his writings, he did incorporate the concept of elemental forces within his broader philosophical framework. He believed in a hierarchy of beings, including angels and demons, but his focus was primarily on the divine and human realms, not on the detailed classification of nature spirits like those described in alchemical and esoteric traditions. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Aquinas's View on Elements and Beings: 
* <u>**[Elements as Physical Principles:](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=601b0517c7361365&hl=en-us&cs=1&q=Elements+as+Physical+Principles&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiykoKTrYuNAxWVhYkEHZuvFwwQ4eYNegQIEhAD&mstk=AUtExfCSxBnWw5JFkLYIUGHVCzebs5ZJU_0RNV3ZJ2dQkzTKGvtklm826Me-jL4WwYXaXXewWXR5yDH07aMNAr7yOQyr-W6In6WWkyxw1pmLgAcdlcJEC5jWCVOX1yFovimy2r4&csui=3)**</u>Aquinas saw the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire) as fundamental physical principles rather than distinct beings. He understood them as the building blocks of the material world. 
* <u>**[Hierarchy of Beings:](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=601b0517c7361365&hl=en-us&cs=1&q=Hierarchy+of+Beings&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiykoKTrYuNAxWVhYkEHZuvFwwQ4eYNegQIIhAD&mstk=AUtExfCSxBnWw5JFkLYIUGHVCzebs5ZJU_0RNV3ZJ2dQkzTKGvtklm826Me-jL4WwYXaXXewWXR5yDH07aMNAr7yOQyr-W6In6WWkyxw1pmLgAcdlcJEC5jWCVOX1yFovimy2r4&csui=3)**</u>He believed in a hierarchical structure of beings, with God at the top, followed by angels, then humans, and then animals and plants. This hierarchy was based on the level of perfection and spiritual capacity. 
* <u>**[Nature's Role:](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=601b0517c7361365&hl=en-us&cs=1&q=Nature%27s+Role&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiykoKTrYuNAxWVhYkEHZuvFwwQ4eYNegQIIRAD&mstk=AUtExfCSxBnWw5JFkLYIUGHVCzebs5ZJU_0RNV3ZJ2dQkzTKGvtklm826Me-jL4WwYXaXXewWXR5yDH07aMNAr7yOQyr-W6In6WWkyxw1pmLgAcdlcJEC5jWCVOX1yFovimy2r4&csui=3)**</u>Aquinas believed that nature was created by God to serve as a means to understand and appreciate the divine, and that it was not inherently evil or subject to chaotic forces. 
* <u>**[No Elementals in His Writings:](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=601b0517c7361365&hl=en-us&cs=1&q=No+Elementals+in+His+Writings&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiykoKTrYuNAxWVhYkEHZuvFwwQ4eYNegQIHhAD&mstk=AUtExfCSxBnWw5JFkLYIUGHVCzebs5ZJU_0RNV3ZJ2dQkzTKGvtklm826Me-jL4WwYXaXXewWXR5yDH07aMNAr7yOQyr-W6In6WWkyxw1pmLgAcdlcJEC5jWCVOX1yFovimy2r4&csui=3)**</u>While Aquinas used the concept of elements, he did not delve into the detailed classification and characteristics of "elemental beings" or "nature spirits" like Gnomes (earth), Undines (water), Sylphs (air), and Salamanders (fire). 
Elemental Beings in Other Traditions: 
* <u>**[Paracelsus](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=601b0517c7361365&hl=en-us&cs=1&q=Paracelsus&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiykoKTrYuNAxWVhYkEHZuvFwwQxccNegQIKRAB&mstk=AUtExfCSxBnWw5JFkLYIUGHVCzebs5ZJU_0RNV3ZJ2dQkzTKGvtklm826Me-jL4WwYXaXXewWXR5yDH07aMNAr7yOQyr-W6In6WWkyxw1pmLgAcdlcJEC5jWCVOX1yFovimy2r4&csui=3)**</u>**:**A 16th-century alchemist, Paracelsus, popularized the idea of elemental beings, including Gnomes, Undines, Sylphs, and Salamanders, associating them with the four classical elements. 
* **Occult and Esoteric Traditions:**The concept of elementals became prominent in occult and esoteric traditions, which often viewed them as powerful spiritual forces or nature spirits. 
* **No Direct Connection to Aquinas:**There is no direct connection between Aquinas's theological framework and the more detailed and elaborate descriptions of elemental beings found in occult and esoteric traditions. 
In Summary: 
Aquinas's writings do not feature detailed discussions of salamanders, gnomes, or other elemental beings. While he acknowledged the existence of elemental forces, his primary focus was on the divine and human realms, and he didn't engage with the more fantastical interpretations of nature spirits found in alchemical and esoteric circles.
