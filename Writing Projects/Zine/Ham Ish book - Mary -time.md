Hey Mary, 

Thanks for sending that link.  

Want to meet this week or next @5pm? 



Books I will not be reading anytime soon

Last we talked, I mentioned this article that describes Thoreau’s experience on this mountain, how it instilled in him a “savage and dreary” state rather than the accustomed exalted state, and the effect this had on him.  see page 91:

At one point, I had hoped to read some of Bron Taylor’s course materials, but that never materialized.  He has a book called “Dark Green Religion” and in trying to find the above article, I came across another writer: 

Timothy Morton has a book called “Dark Ecology”, a term that expresses the “irony, ugliness, and horror” of ecology (he has a background in romantic/gothic literature).

In previous books, he: 
- rejects the nature-civilization divide: nature exists both within / without society’s walls.  
- Says artistic representations of nature can be sites for rethinking nature.  
- Says Ecological claims have no neutral / natural vantage point.  Such claims constitute varied ways of coping with current ecological catastrophe.  
- Promotes the non-privileging internconnectedness of non/living things. 
- Coins the term hyperobject, which are objects that are so dispersed that they transcend space-time specificity.  Examples include global warming, styrofoam, plutonium.   

Lastly, Rudolf Otto (not Otto Rank, as I had said) said when we experience what is ‘totally other’, we experience what he calls the “mysterious tremendum y fascinans” , an experience that elicits silence + terror.  The terror is also described as “creature-feeling”, “dependence”, “demonic dread”, the “wrath of god”, and ‘awe’-fullness. 

Awe is a complex emotion characterized by a mix or positive and negative affect - one feels contentment + fear, horror, humility.  Awe is related to the experience of the sublime, and both are related to the themes of the sacred / holy.

Randomly, I came across an article that made the following suggestion:
 
When is in the presence of what could be awe-inspiring, one of 3 things might happen: 
- A person assimilates the experience into their mental categories. This leads to increased psychic rigidity.  
- A person accommodate to the experience, changing their mental categories.  This leads to increased psychic flexibility.
- If assimilation and accommodation fails, then a form of psychopathy / trauma is experienced.

collecting data for this book. He mentions the discovery that Native Americans shunned West Virginia, and that no Indian tribes can be identified as indigenous to that State. 18He refers to maps of pre- Columbian tribes worked out by modern anthropologists and published by Hammond in which the area we know as West Virginia is marked as “uninhabited.” No one seems to know why the Indians didn’t settle there, when the land itself would certainly have supported a large population in terms of fish, game, and vegetation. What is found in West Virginia, however, are petroglyphs and other evidence in stone pointing to the existence of wandering Europeans. There is also a heavy concentration of Adena sites northwest and northeast of Charleston, along the Kanawha and Elk Rivers, sites that date to the first millennium B.C. 19 Keel wonders if the Native Americans avoided West Virginia because of something they knew, and something the Europeans didn’t know. Something inherently strange about the place. A sinister force.


The Narragansetts of the New England region, the Adena of Ohio, and the Lenape dog-rib Indians of California are known to have forged links with entities spawned in the Mauve Zone, and in the outer rings of Yuggoth. 28
(The “Mauve Zone” is Grant’s term for the Abyss, to be discussed in more detail in the next chapter; it is also, in Grant’s words, “a supreme power-zone of magical energy.” 29The Abyss, for purposes of this citation, may be considered as the realm of demonic beings. The “outer rings of Yuggoth” are a reference to Lovecraft’s tales.)
If Funkhouser and Webb are to be believed, Ashland was the busiest Adena site in the Commonwealth. The five burial mounds in Central Park would be the tip of an ancient iceberg of mounds and other earthworks, many of which were destroyed as the town was growing
