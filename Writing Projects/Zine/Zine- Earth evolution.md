the ability to create and find patterns in related images.  We recognize patterns in order to acquire knowledge.  Knowledge, ownership and perception of images, is the basis of intelligence.  But these images are the intelligence itself. Thus, in knowing these images, it knows itself.  God knows all things and their relations.  These exist within him as his ideas.

The ability to enact from these images in endless and purposeful ways, enacting these events in a way that align with one’s goals and values.  This enactment of the self and creation.  This allows for free will, which creates a space for evil; however, certain evils can bring about greater goods. God wills these ideas into being and allies himself with them.

The ability to show appropriate concern for these enactments, to guide how these enactments relate to one another, such that creativity and care is present.   This judgment of goodness complements justice.  In this case, mercy expresses the fullness of justice.  Grace, the extension of love-substance into the world, maintains creation in existence.  God loves and sustains these ideas.

Map onto a tree
Father - As ideas in root-form, he is the roots (Transcendent / Unseen).  Connects to inner sun. Its roots are hidden beneath the surface, expressing a transcendent nature, which is beyond direct perception.  These roots anchor and sustain all existence, the nature of divinity.
Son - As bridge, he is the trunk. Its trunk articulate the nature of the hidden roots into a potential that can be actualized (as visible branches).  Thus it deconstructs, bridges, reconciles these extreme ends: binaries of divinity-humanity, transcendence-immanence, life-death.  
Holy Spirit - As expression of these ideas, he is hte leaves. (Immanent aspect) Connects to outer sun.Its branches reach outward, bearing leaves and fruit, symbolizing growth and expansion, love, guiding and nurturing life within creation, drawing the world towards spirit transformation (holiness), empowering us to live virtuous lives and grow sanctified. 

Overall: each mediates and interconnects. , working in the context of creation, guidance, redemption.  

1 - Heat - creation of the metaphysic

The triad expresses a form of radiating heat.  Because of its proximity to its source, this heat crystallizes into a myriad of points that grow in power and number. These are seeds that will unfold into forms that contain the ideas of gods, which these forms will spend and eternity assuming and coming to understand.  
Imitating the threefold dynamic of source, it creates a space within itself for these ideas, which becomes the foundation / blueprint for the future universe.

Transition
This nature, having expressed itself inwardly, also unfold outwardly as 3 tiers. 
Version 1 - these 3 tiers are the 3 hierarchies, of which it is the first.  These 3 reconcile themselves in the 4th - the earth.  
Version 2 - these 3 tiers do not include itself, but the other 2 + earth.  The earth reflects Foundation, the angelic reflect the ideas, and the principalities (2nd) reflect the realm of forms. 
Hierarchy 2 - the airey / etheric substance > downward facing due to its proximity? > the will to individuate.  (Dominions, Virtues, Power)

Version 1 - this is the idea realm and H3 is the Foundation round - these reconcile as the earth.  

Version 2 - this is the realm of forms, H3 of ideas, and H4 the kingdom **

This realm of forms is also the realm of will, actualizing the potential of the seraphim’s knowledge. 

Being a step removed from the source, they develop the ability for antipathy, doubt, necessary for their work.   
When they perceive the dream of matter, their doubt is stirred, their faith challenged, and they charge into celestial battle.  
From this battle, we have “fallen” angels.  These differ from the “retarded” angels that emerge with each new stage of sleep. 
H3 - watery astral substance - upward facing due to its distance.  The will to reunite. (Principalities, Archangels, Angels)

V2 - this is the realm of ideas, the details of transcendent knowledge, express themselves as a reflection upon the celestial battle in hopes of finding reconciliation.  

Saturnian Age. 
At the start of the saturn age, H3 was an immaterial planet-scape at the level of plant, animal, and human life.  The Archai were waking humans, the Archangels, dreaming animals, the Angels were sleeping plants. 
H2 oversaw this growth, mediating between above and below.  Above was fixated on the objective light.  
Sun 
While the three hierarchies symbolize different aspects of the divine emanations, Malkuth serves as a point of convergence for & symbolic reconciliation &  materialization of these energies in the physical.  
Malkuth arises a a collection of entranced points of heat.  
These heat points create a space of air within itself.  (Human) / Sleeping ones
Other heat points are unable. (Mineral) / Trance
Do the abled absorb a third element from the disabled? A Saturnian shadow?
Moon / Division? 
The air within humans partial condense to astral-water / Dreaming ones

Those that could not do this remained asleep. 

The entranced one remained the same. 

The battle in heaven recapitulated as the second hierarchy learned of plans. 

Earth / Inversion Fourth unfolding: Shevirah~Singularity: spirit to mater (ether) / Reconciliation

A being experiences a reflection with such intensity that 
the reflection becomes a being
Or the relation between the two (isn’t this the actual reflection) becomes a being). 
The hierarchy is a cycle of reflection. 

Eventually, reflective energies invert upon itself, causing the universe to contract so intensely that it is following by the Big Bang, yielding parallel psychic and material fields (energy and matter).  
 
Matter undergoes various states. 

Various planetary spirits unfold, and that of the Earth materializes as a Fireball…  Around 4.6 billion years ago, Earth formed within the Sun's protoplanetary disk, starting as a molten spheroid with scorching temperatures. 

As a fireball,, it emitted heat and gasses into space, but some gasses were trapped by Earth’s gravitational field, forming the first atmosphere.  (Fire > air) This atmosphere both retained some of its heat and shielded the planet from the Sun’s intense radiation.  

Atmosphere unfolds as rain resulting in oceans and land masses. 

Some 4 billion years ago, In the deepest part of the ocean, hydrothermal vents would create high temperature spaces that would be populated by the common ancestral cell.  It had a lipid bilateral that used DNA, RNA, and protein. 

From these types of cells, bacteria, arachaea, and eukaryotic would originate.  

, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukarya originated.  

Bacteria
Cell wall - protective layer that surrounds cell membrane
Cell membrane - lipid layer surrounding cell.
Genetic machinery - center to be protected, consisting of a DNA molecule that carries info about cells function and reproduction, plasmids have genes that contain info about antibiotic resistance or ability to metabolize, ribosomes which synthesize protein, RNA polymerase to transcribe DNA into RNA, RNA being the template for protein synthesis. Opeons organize genes that transcribe together. And regulatory proteins that control the expression of genes.   
Found in soil, water, and living organisms



Archaea
Cells walls diversify.  Membranes that thrive in intense environments.  Genetics closer to eukaryotes. early bacteria

Eukaryotes
develop a true nucleus, a membrane bound organelle that houses the cell’s DNA
Contain membrane-bound organelles - like mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc
Have mitochondria or chloroplast for energy production advanced. 
Larger in size. 
Reproduce through mitosis (asexual) or meiosis (sexual) and have complex life cycles.  Bacteria reproduce via binary fission (asexual).  


Approximately two billion years ago, the methane haze dissipated, giving rise to the blue sky.

Among eukaryotes, one branch developed a photosynthetic metabolism, which convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into oxygen (plants - sleeping consciousness)


The other developed a mitochondrial driven metabolism, which would evolve into animals, exhaling carbon dioxide, encouraging the growth of more plants.  Do all animals do this?  (Dreaming consciousness) 

Finally, the animal life sheds an aspect of itself, giving rise to the human (waking consciousness), which would eventually seek to connect with the Earth spirit through the noosphere.   

This waking object-consciousness - gaining the ability to see both the psychic and material aspects of reality, and with it, cultivate the symbolic, such as language, art, and technology, which were used to delve into the depths of nature. This leads to the creation of the noosphere. 

In the future, These lineages will undergo further transformations until the Apex is reached, when humanity will reabsorb (unite with) the Earth, and the both are reabsorbed (united with) the other spheres of our solar systems, eventually becoming the Saturn-Solar-Earth-human system.  

Likewise
angels have gone from sleeping to psychic beings.
