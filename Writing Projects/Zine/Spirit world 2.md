# Spirit world 2


<u>**Existence**</u>
* There are 2 kinds of things: existence and existing things. 
* Existing things are caused by and depend on existence. 
* Of existing things, there is the immaterial and the material. 

<u>**Material**</u> 
1. Material things are composed of matter and form.  Form is an organizing principle, and thus immaterial.  It shapes matter. 
2. Some material things possess cognition and give rise to ideas, which are immaterial dependencies. 
3. Human  souls are the animating form of the body during life and capable of existing independently after death, awaiting the resurrection, when it receives judgment.  

<u>**Lesser Immaterial beings**</u>
* Ideas & Information: these entities are dependent on material processes or objects for their being.  For example, ideas depend upon a mind.  They require sensory interactions with the material world.  Information relies on material media for storage and transmission.  Its meaning is independent of physical form, but its accessibility is not.
* Thought-forms: quasi-independent sets of ideas, or energies that bring ideas (or ideologies) to life, potentially influencing how they are interpreted and enacted.  They are generated and powered by collective thought and emotion.  They also possess some agency, capable of influencing individuals or events.  They can achieve temporary quasi-independent existence through autopoesis, or through the influence of higher immaterial agents, such as fallen angels, which use these forms to exert influence on the world.
* disembodied souls: connected to the material world through memories and experiences.   Yet they are independent of matter. 
* Elementals - elementary matter is prime matter informed by primary forms.  These forms are associated with elementals - the active principles.  Elementals may have a king.  
* Poltergeists cause disturbances.  

<u>**Disembodied souls (kinds)**</u>
* ghosts, which are earthbound, attached to the material realm.  Some are in purgatory, permitted by god to interact with the living to require prayers or convey messages.  Some ghostly apparitions are actually demonic, manifestations of fallen angels seeking to drive and tempt. 
* lost souls, in purgatory, a sate of transition and purification, perhaps confused or disoriented as they navigate the afterlife.  
* enlightened souls, and these exist in glory. They attain a higher spiritual understanding or union with god.  
* For aquinas there are only 2 states: blessed  souls died in a state of grace, accepting god’s forgiveness and love.  They reside in heaven and experience imperfect happiness contemplating god indirectly through divine ideas.  The dammed died in a state of mortal sin, having willfully rejected god’s grace.  They experience eternal separation from god and suffer the consequences in hell.  

<u>**Immaterial**</u> 
1. Immaterial beings are composed of form alone. 
2. They exists in a hierarchy of perfection, varying in their power, functions, intellectual functions, and proximity to God.   This structure mirrors the great chain of being.
3. In contrast to this celestial hierarchy, there is the realm of the damned: Fallen angels who turn to god. 
4. Angels can use lesser immaterial beings to their own ends. 

<u>**Exotic objects**</u>
* Alternative dimensions have different laws of physics, leading to matter whose very nature is different, possessing properties that seem impossible from our perspective.  Such matter might have negative mass or interact through forces unknown to us.  Such an exotic mater (energy or information) could be exchanged between dimensions, potentially affecting evolution in both spaces.

* Such universes might be ruled by alternative logics - different mathematical structures governing geometric shapes, different ways angels or humans contemplate god and creation, different ways of knowing and understanding, holding power, each reflecting the unique immaterial structures.

<u>**Process**</u>
god and pure potential, from which arise, through an act of creation, immaterial objects and material objects. 

Immaterial objects are volitional and intellectual potential + form. 
Material objects are prime matter + prime form => elements + substantial form => material objects 

* why do material objects go through 2 transformations > elements and then object?

<u>**Flat ontologies**</u>

Reality is ordered on a hierarchy based on their degree of perfection, however, in a couple senses these being s may be considered to exist on the same ontological level, without hierarchy or subordination. 

From the perspective of a creator, all objects are equally created beings.  They all derive their existence from god and are contingent upon him.  Their differences in perfection are differences in participation, not in their fundamental ontological status as crated beings. 

Also, this structure has the greatest swerving and supporting the eweakest.  Service to creation can be understood as an act of love.  God sustains the universe, providing the conditions for creatures to freely unite with him.  Angels are meant to serve and aid humans, and humans are meant to do the same for the mineral world.  But is it possible that humans enable angels in the way that the mineral world enables the condition for humans to survive?

<u>**Process.**</u>

God’s initial act o creation describes the exuding of prime matter as an aura of non-being..  he brings forth the potentiality for being from his own infinite being.  This is an expression of his eternal power.  This cloud of potential (prime matter/intellectual -volitional potential) isn’t  a seperate realm but rather intermingled with the world, proving the underlying potentiality for all material substances.  It implies an indirect involvement of god in the world, where his creative act establishes the condition for existence, but the actualization of specific forms abad substances occurs through the interaction of potenatilty and the forms imposed by god.  This cloud is a kind of shadow or echo of his infinite being, the ground of potentiality upon which creation unfolds.  

In this light, pure potential emitted by god is the basis for prime matter in material objects and the volitional and intellectual potential in immaterial objects. They both have this potential in common. 

<u>**Degrees**</u>
1. Pure actuality
2. Pure potentiality
	1. Elements (via prime matter) > substantial forms
		1. Prime matter + prime form = element
		2. Element + substantial form = object
	2. Volitional-intellectual potentiality > immaterial forms.
		1. V/I potential + form = object
