One way of creating is by imitation
Another way is to imitate and modify
And if possible the greatest way would be to create by imitation and allow the creation to modify itself within reason. This reason would be called the laws of nature.  

A creator is by definition an intelligence since an intelligence is necessary to sufficient know enough to create.  

Intelligence is defined by possessing and using knowledge. Hence we have the being, the knowledge such a being possesses, and the ability or use that this being makes of this
Knowledge.  

This threefold nature would certainly mark its creation.   

It does so in two ways

If this creator is being and its first emanation is knowledge the. The second would be what it has done with this knowledge.  Thus we have two degrees of creation as well as the creator

We could say that it creates a threefold entity and its experience of this entity brings forth a third. 

This dynamic
Might extend through all creation.  Consider my experience of a material tree and how it gives birth to a metaphysical object we call an idea inspired by the tree.  We perceive a twofold being.  The sensual tree and the conceptual tree. We and the two fold perception make three. 

If the initial creation is threefold maybe each aspect of this creation must express itself.  Being expresses itself as 2. Knowledge as 3.  Doing as 4.

“dianoia” refers to discursive thought and reasoning, while “nous” refers to a higher form of intellect or intuitive understanding. “Dianoia” involves logical and analytical thinking, while “nous” is often associated with direct insight or intuitive knowledge.

There is myself and
My knowledge with which I have an intimate knowledge but then there is what arises from knowledge to which my relation is mediated by knowledge.  It’s once removed.  

There is me and my intuitive relation which gives rise to a rational relation.  And we are ourselves relating to the world in these two modes. 

And so is the world. 

Reducing the concept of "self" to its key aspects, we might consider:

1. **Consciousness and Awareness:** The fundamental aspect of being aware of one's existence, thoughts, and experiences.

2. **Personal Identity:** This includes self-knowledge, values, beliefs, and a sense of one's individuality.

3. **Actions and Interactions:** How an individual interacts with their surroundings, including their behaviors, choices, and relationships.

These aspects capture some fundamental elements of the self, but it's important to remember that the self is a deeply complex and multifaceted concept that defies complete reduction to just a few components.

Father intelligence
Son will which proceeds from intelligence.  
Holy Spirit is love between. This is communal connective what makes the two one.  

The understanding of the Son as both the divine will and an expression of God's will is a complex theological concept. It is rooted in the traditional Christian understanding of the Trinity and can be explained as follows:

1. **The Son as the Divine Will:** In Christian theology, the Son is often associated with the divine will because the Son proceeds from the Father's divine intellect or mind. Just as our thoughts are often accompanied by our will to act, the Son's procession from the Father is seen as an expression of the Father's divine will. This procession is considered an eternal generation, meaning that the Son is generated by the Father's intellect, and this generation reflects the divine will.

2. **The Son as an Expression of God's Will:** The Son, often referred to as the "Word" or the "Logos," is the self-expression of God's wisdom and will. This means that the Son is the means by which God's will and purpose are revealed and communicated. In Christian theology, it is through the Son that God's will is made known and enacted in the world. The Son is the divine agent through which God's will is manifested, especially in the act of creation and redemption.

In summary, the Son's role as both the divine will and an expression of God's will is a theological understanding within the doctrine of the Trinity. It highlights the interplay between the persons of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and their unique roles in revealing and carrying out the will of God. This is a complex and deeply philosophical concept central to Christian theology and requires careful consideration to fully grasp.
