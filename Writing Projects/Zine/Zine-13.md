Energy and matter exists in space

Can we strip e
And m from space?

If so we would still have an existence.         Space is something.  

Not visible but something we might exist in and drift through.  

A property of this space is counter space.  

A folding in of space 

We might imagine this as the inner life of space

Just as I have an inner life.  A subjectivity so might this space

A space more acquainted with the infinite.  Whose geometry is less Euclidean. 

Much like there are degrees of complexity extending space there are degrees of abstraction imposing upon space.  

**the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics**.

Love has infinite instances

If each instance has knowledge of itself and then performance of itself we thus have a body who presence is creative and invokes creation.  

An immaterial performance
Gives rise to a material one. 

If we are a further condensation are there subsequent condensations.   Or is there a reversion to abstraction

If humanity is born.  Then in knowing itself it gives rise to knowledge which is a thing more.   Then performance. Which is astral.  

New triad.  Space energy matter 

What acts on this fiery solidity?

Plants.  Cooling it down.  To air?

Animals to liquid 

Human to solidity?

Human animals plant 

Then heat is medium that mAterializes. 

plants mold mineral

Animal mold plant

Human molds aniimL

Angels
Mold human
Toward greater abstraction

As solidity reverts to fluid gas heat.
