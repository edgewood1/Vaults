I am one substance not two
However my one substance is composed of flesh/bone (matter) and form (that which arranges and directs my flesh/bones and endows it with certain powers.   These powers are both bodily and mental thus my ability to think but also my bodily ability to perceive thru my eyes are both functions of my form.  I. This sense mind and body are unified under my Regis of who I am.  If my brain breaks, this will impair my ability to think clearly and likewise I can think myself into physical calmness. However upon death my form departs from flesh and bone which then become no longer who I am but becomes relatively quickly ashes and dust.
