**Definition:** 
The context of an expression or a text is the social situation in which something is said. It includes any information relevant to understanding the appropriate use of an expression or the interpretation of a text.
**Discussion:** 
The context of an expression answers the following questions:
* Who said it? Who was addressed?
* What were the circumstances? What was the occasion?
* When was this word or expression used? When was the text given?
* Where was it spoken?
* Why was it spoken?
* How was it spoken? How was it received?


Consciousness is a unified awareness OF something
1. percepts from the world
2. concepts associated with percepts

Concepts vs Ideas
1. Idea is a thought about something
2. we can have many ideas about a percept
3. but there’s an underlying unifying concept - or form - that inspires these ideas; usually invisible to us.

Thus, we can talk about 2 aspects of the immaterial
1. world of ideas becoming
1. world of form

Lastly, these are grounded in a setting / landscape
1. ideas
2. forms
3. formless / endless

Thus two world - material and immateral

What chacterizes the content of each is the distinction between essence and existence. 

1. what a thing is
2. that a thing is - a thing HAS existence

If a thing were existence, would it be eternal and the foundation of all things, experienced only through all things? Yet, form can’t be this since fom is a thing and existence is not?  

and yet what is the formless? It is the formless from the perspective of us, space seems like a vacuum, but the reality is that as potent as form. 

matter
objects + life + landscape
ideas + concept + landscape
