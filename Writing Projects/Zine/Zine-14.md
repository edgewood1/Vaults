About 20ft away, the tree stands, swaying, rustling in the wind.  

The tree is not a figment of fantasy, dream, or memory.  I am awake.  I am clear.  I perceive an accurate account.   

About 20ft away, the tree stands, swaying, rustling in the wind.  


4- sight
 
From the sun, light streams down and hits the tree.

The tree’s chemical make-up reflects certain wavelengths, some of which the eyes capture.  

The properties of these waves are organized, interpreted, and transformed into the conscious experience that we call a perception. 

Much like the sun emits radiant light, our psyche emits its own inward-streaming light and engages with the recieved light to form its own image. (a percept)

Variety of image

When our eyes are open, this inner light can mimic what is seen.  (percept)
It can distort these light (imagination) or deepen into this light (imaginal).

If we gaze at the tree then close our eyes, the tree-image’s glowing yet fading outline will continue as an after-image before it fades into imagination.

Tomorrow, I can turn my attention back to this moement, and reinvoke this image as memory.  

Aspects of the tree remain alive within me.  Much as the light waves carrying information about the tree are “turn into” or “fold into” conscious experience. / Consciousness is a folding in of hte world. 

Are these acts of unfolding ourselves or the world?  

8- Hearing

The wind rustles through leaves, releasing a chain reaction of energy coursing through the particles of air between us. As this energy wave hits my ear drum, I sense it.  I associate it with the tree.   If we had no sight, we could still associate it, and gather information about the distance of the tree, the intensity of the wind, the nature of the leaves and branches. 

9- Touch

We could feel the wind against our skin, and the climate that the tree is inhabiting. But to touch the tree requires a greater act of will - contracting the space between ourselves and it.  After closing the space, we can place our hand on the bark, and feel its texture, its temperature.   

10- perception

Sensation forms image and estimation.  These are absorbed by imagination and memory.  Together they form perception 

Perception elicits emotion and ideas and desire. 
Emotions can shed light about the nature of our ideas. 
Ideas can shed light about the nature of ourselves, the tree, and the world. 
Ideas are judgments and those ideas that regard our behavior cna help us overcome emotion.
