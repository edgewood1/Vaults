Two aspects of Reality 
- reality / existence itself 
- That which participates in reality
What is participation
- to limit that which is participated in in some respect.  To take part in.  If i take a part in something, i don’t possess the nature of the thing in which i participate in, but only a portion of its nature.  
Three modes of participation
- when something receives what pertains universally to another.  A species (man) participates in its genus (animal) because the species does not possess the intelligible structure of that in which they participate.  That is, species gets its structure from its genus: man is an ANIMAL that reasons. 
- A subject participates in its accidents (i participate in my dreariness) and matter participates in its form (the mater of a statue participates in its shape).  
- An effect participates in its cause the effect particularizases the scope of the cause

Participation conclusions
- essences exist essentially - they participate in their act of existence; ie, an essence limits the the act of existence.  Essence thus merely has existence, it is not existence.  The act of existence is thus limited and individuated to the essence whose act it is.  

What is the difference between existence and an act of existence?  Existence is: 
- act 
- the actuality that all things demonstrate.  
- what forms and is received; not informed and receives. Aristotle saw form as the source of all things, but Aquinas says even form has a source - their actuality.
- Existence is a perfection

What is act? 
- defined in relation to potential
- Binary opposition? 
- One who is awake is a actus to one who is asleep.  sleep is potential wakefulness; 
- When a thing is, but is not however thus as when it is in potential. 
- That which is able to be is said to be in potency; that which is now is said to be in act.  
- S is actually P (P is in act) if S is now P, and is not now potentially P
- The principle by which S is actually P.  What makes it true that I am actually whistling? The very act of whistling. 
- Thus existence is an act - if nothing has actuality unless it exists, then existence is that by which any actuality is actual.  Existence is that by which i actually am.  

Could this be participation? 
- I can only swim if I am in water - if i take part in the experience of water.  My doing this does not diminish the amount of water.  However, I would not be occupying space in god by participating in his existence.
