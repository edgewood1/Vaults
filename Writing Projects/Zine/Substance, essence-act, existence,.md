Kinds of essence

For immaterial substance, essence is expressed as form. 

For material substance, essence is the expression of form and matter, so we can’t identify essence with only with form. 

So there’s two kinds of essence/forms - those that lack mater / material substance, and those that don’t.

Yes, you've grasped the core Thomistic distinction very well! Let's refine the phrasing slightly for maximum clarity and precision.
Here's a breakdown that confirms and elaborates on your understanding:
 * For Immaterial Substances:
   * Your statement: "For immaterial substance, essence is expressed as form."
   * Refinement: "For purely immaterial substances (like angels or God Himself), their essence is their form."
     * Explanation: There is no distinction between essence and form because there's no matter to be informed. The form completely exhausts the essence. An angel's very nature (what it is) is its spiritual form.
 * For Material Substances:
   * Your statement: "For material substance, essence is the expression of form and matter, so we can’t identify essence with only with form."
   * Refinement: "For material substances, their essence is the composite of form and designated matter. Therefore, we cannot identify their essence with form alone."
     * Explanation: The kind of thing a material being is (its essence) includes both its organizing principle (form) and the specific kind of matter that principle informs. For instance, the essence of "human" is "rational animal," which implies a rational soul (form) united to an organic body (matter). The essence of "tree" implies a vegetative soul (form) united to woody matter. While the form is the determining principle of the essence, the full definition of a material essence includes both.
 * Two Kinds of Essence/Forms:
   * Your statement: "So there’s two kinds of essence/forms - those that lack matter / material substance, and those that don’t."
   * Refinement: "Thus, there are fundamentally two kinds of essences (and corresponding forms): those that inherently lack matter (belonging to purely immaterial substances) and those that are inherently united with specific kinds of matter (belonging to material substances)."
     * Explanation: This clearly articulates the fundamental ontological distinction based on the presence or absence of matter in the definition of a being's essence.
In summary, your understanding is correct. The crucial point is that for material things, matter is a co-principle of the essence, whereas for immaterial things, the form alone constitutes the essence.

Substance - This tree with bark leaves, brown. 
Secondary - The kind of tree. 

The kind of tree has  leaves of particular shape, texture, ability that is unique.  And yet it has parts and compounds found in all leaves   This analysis can be applied to the tree as a whole: 

Form - the organization and abilities of the tree. 
Matter - the parts and compounds it is made of. 

We could talk about the form of the tree and the materiality of tree.  

Essence is the composite for form / matter
Substance is the composite of essence and existence.  

Essence compose substance, 
Esssence is composed of form and mater. 

Essence describes the aspect of being / form matter describes the aspect of substance.  

So at heart a thing is comprised of being and substance. It is, and it is in a particular way. 

Tree essence consists of form and matter; which implies it’s substance has a particular shape and function that is primarily material.  

Because  its has existence, we can experience it. 

If there were a tree spirit, this would lack matter.  It’s tree essence would consist of form alone, which implies is substance would be primarily immaterial.  But because it has existence, we could experience, but through our mind alone. 

===

 * Material Tree: The essence is the composite of form + matter. The substance is the individual, existing thing that embodies this essence. Because it is a material substance, its properties are physical and perceivable by our senses.
 * Immaterial Tree Spirit: The essence is the form alone. The substance is the individual, existing thing that embodies this immaterial essence. Because it is an immaterial substance, its properties are not physical, and it would be accessible to our intellect rather than our senses.

How about: a substance is essence that has existence, and this essence can be composed of form or form and matter.

Level of being: essence / existence - this is universal 
Level of composition (kind of essence):  matter / form - this is not. 
Subject: substance


This is a very insightful and sophisticated attempt to synthesize all the concepts we've discussed into a single, cohesive framework. Your structure is logical and your definitions are largely on point. You're trying to create a clear hierarchy of principles, which is an excellent way to approach this material.
Let's review and refine your statements for maximum clarity and metaphysical precision, building on the foundation you've laid.
Review and Refinement
1. "A thing is composed of various principles."
 * Evaluation: Accurate and concise. This is a perfect starting point.
 * Refinement: None needed. This is a solid Thomistic premise.
2. "A principle is a foundational ground or source from which something else proceeds. It is an explanation."
 * Evaluation: Accurate. You've correctly identified that principles are not things, but the roots of a thing's being and the starting points of a metaphysical explanation.
 * Refinement: The term "indignation" in your last sentence seems to be a typo for "individuation." Assuming that, the rest of the sentence is excellent.
3. "there are two sets of principles - those that function on the level of being, and those that function on the level of substance."
 * Evaluation: This is a brilliant way of framing the two perspectives we discussed (Essence/Existence and Form/Matter). You've correctly identified them as two levels of analysis.
 * Refinement: This is a strong conceptual distinction. It's not a Thomistic term, but it's a very helpful way to organize the concepts.
4. "On the first level, existence, the principle of being, and essence, the principle of what a thing is."
 * Evaluation: Perfect. You've correctly identified the two principles of the "being" level of analysis.
 * Refinement: None needed. This is a flawless summary of the Essence/Existence distinction.
5. "On the second level, form, the principle of actuality and specific nature, and matter, the principle of potentiality and individuation."
 * Evaluation: Perfect. You've correctly identified the two principles of the "substantial" level of analysis (hylomorphism). The correction of "indignation" to "individuation" is crucial here, as matter is what makes an essence a particular, individual instance.
 * Refinement: None needed (assuming the typo fix).
6. "On a substantial level a tree is composed of organic compounds that assume a particular form."
 * Evaluation: This statement conflates the metaphysical and scientific levels of analysis. "Organic compounds" and "a particular form" are not the same as "prime matter" and "substantial form" in a strict sense. Organic compounds are already composites of form and matter.
 * Refinement: We need to keep the metaphysical and scientific levels distinct.
   * Metaphysical Level: A tree is a substance composed of prime matter and a vegetative soul (its substantial form).
   * Scientific Level: A tree is composed of organic compounds (cellulose, lignin, etc.).
   * We can link them by saying that the prime matter is the ultimate substrate of the organic compounds, and the substantial form is what organizes those compounds into a living tree.
7. "On a metaphysical level a tree has being that assumes a particular form. The form it assumes is called essence in regard to existence, and form in regard to matter or substance."
 * Evaluation: This is a very interesting and sophisticated attempt at synthesis, but it's a bit convoluted and technically inaccurate.
   * "has being that assumes a particular form": This is backwards. The substance has its form and matter, and then receives being (esse). The being doesn't "assume a form."
   * "The form it assumes is called essence in regard to existence, and form in regard to matter or substance": This is an overcomplication that is not metaphysically precise.
     * The essence is the composite of form and matter. It's not the form assuming a name.
     * The form is a principle of the essence. It's not a name for the essence in a particular context.
A Corrected and Coherent Synthesis
Let's combine all of your correct premises into a more precise and flowing text. We'll keep your elegant structure.
Revised Text
A thing is a substance, and every substance is a composite of principles. A principle is a foundational ground or source from which something else proceeds, serving as a root of explanation.
We can analyze a substance through two sets of metaphysical principles:
 * On the level of Being: A substance is a composite of existence (the principle of being, that a thing is) and essence (the principle of what a thing is).
 * On the level of Substance: The essence of a material thing, in turn, is a composite of form (the principle of actuality and specific nature) and matter (the principle of potentiality and individuation).
From a substantial perspective, a tree is composed of prime matter that is actualized and organized by a vegetative soul (its substantial form). This form makes it a living tree with specific powers.
From a metaphysical perspective, a tree is (receives the act of existence) and it is in a particular way (its essence). The essence defines what the tree is, and this essence is composed of its vegetative soul and the matter it informs. The form, being the actualizing principle, is often referred to as the tree's defining nature, while the matter is the principle that makes it this individual tree.
This hierarchical composition—with principles constituting a more fundamental principle, which in turn constitutes the substance—is the core of Thomistic thought.

Principles are metaphysical forces. They have causal power, just like a physical force.  Matter is the passive force that allows form to be embodied in a particular way and change.  Form is an organizational force.  Existence is a force of being, and essence is a defining force? 

They are immaterial but real - you can not hold the vegetative reality of a tree in your hand. 

they are dynamic and active.  

But principles are not seperate independent agents, and they are both efficient and final cause.  Physical forces are agents? And only efficient? 

For main principles

Principles of substance and being

Form and matter compose essence
Essence and existence compose substance. 

[form + matter] + existence => substance, which has powers, which are actualized as operations.

That's an insightful way of organizing the principles, and it's a very helpful framework for understanding the hierarchy of a substance's being.
Yes, you can logically and accurately organize the principles this way:
 * Substance Principles (Form and Matter): These are the co-principles that make up a thing's essence and its physical being. They answer the question, "What is it made of?"
 * Being Principles (Essence and Existence): These are the co-principles that make a thing a reality. They answer the question, "That it is, and what it is?"
 * Action Principles (Powers and Operations): These are the principles that describe what a thing does. They answer the question, "What can it do, and what is it doing?"
This organization is metaphysically sound because it moves from the most fundamental level of a thing's being (its form and matter), to its actual existence (essence and existence), and finally to its dynamic activity in the world (powers and operations).
The Hierarchical Flow
This structure reinforces the hierarchical flow we discussed earlier:
 * Form and Matter compose the Essence.
 * Essence and Existence compose the Substance.
 * The Substance has Powers (which flow from its essence/form).
 * The Powers are actualized as Operations.
Therefore, organizing them into these three sets of principles is a perfectly valid and coherent way to analyze the nature of a substance in Thomistic metaphysics. Each set of principles describes a different, but dependent, aspect of the thing's reality.
