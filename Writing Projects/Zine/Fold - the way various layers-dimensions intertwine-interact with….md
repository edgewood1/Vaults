Fold - the way various layers/dimensions intertwine/interact with each other. 

A social system has physical, conceptual, and social-emotional aspects - these overlap and entangle.

Thus, a social system is a fold.  It consists of various smaller systems interacting in unforeseen ways. 

Reality is composed of folding and unfolding processes. These are dynamic processes, constantly creating new connections and potentials. It’s like an oragami creating new shapes. 

A fabric folds, creating 2 layers / dimensions.  As it further bends, more layers and patterns are created, creating more complexity. In the end we have a network of creases and curves that give the fabric a unique character

Applied to material elements only: a seed grows into a tree through a series of folding- branches and leaves are individual folds, each new growth creates a fold, seeking to optimize photosynthesis.  Cells fold to encourage exchange. 

When branches extend out - unfold, where potentiality of branch growth is actualized.  

Fold - a wind blows and bends branches - this creates a temporary fold, allowing branches to dissipate force of wind, reducing breakage.  Leaves may curl in response to heat in order to minimize water loss.

Fold - a hidden dimension / internal complexity within the tree’s existence. Folds in fabric create hidden spaces that support the whole.  

We see the tree, but beneath is a hidden root system that entendí underground and anchors and nourishes.  

Also hidden within the trunk are the growth rings, that symbolize the tree’s temporal folds, representing its journey through time.

Form and matter and interdependent aspects of substance.  A Tree is the interplay of form and matter. It is form folded into matter. It is the result of this.  The form gives shape, purpose, and specific character to matter, while matter provides material basis for the form.  Form itself is the organization of essence and existence.    Folds cna represent the interplay of the two - esssence provides the fundamental principles or qualities th at define the nature of the thing, while existence is the actual instantiating or realization of that essence.  Both are intricately folded together. Form emerges from the folding of essence and existence.
