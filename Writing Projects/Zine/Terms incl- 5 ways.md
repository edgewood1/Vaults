1. A tree can be physically described
2. I am the union of my soul and the world (my life-history, and currently, the tree I’m looking at).  The tree is a union of its soul and the history of its place, which currently includes me.  Currently, I am a part of the world that is seeking to define it, so I have a chance of contributing to its development.  But how?  Perception consists of projection and observation - what I project is what I feed the other; what it consumes.  My perception reflects an aspect of my personality.  So in my perception i can see that aspect.  However my personality, along with my perception, is potentially vast (being attributes of my soul), and so can expand or contract.  In expanding, we learn more.  If we cultivate the skill to expand, we also expand our personality.  What I pour into you is my personality - its current state.  Ideally, we pour in our best self.  We give the world our best self.  And eventually this best self becomes our normal self.   
3. Your material aspect is composed of atoms that dance along the fabric of space-time, and even here, I sense myself 
4. I could see you as a cognitive category or an aesthetic event.  The latter would require vulnerability.
5. Recipe for seeing: When I was an animal, I only experienced the aesthetic event; how to invoke this? We could use the memory of an old friend to cultivate warmth, and apply this warmth to our perception of a tree.  The emotional resonance of the memory influences your present emotional state, when we turn this state to our perception, we influence how we see the tree.  It colors the perception.  We are more open to appreciate the beauty, serenity, and significance here.  We can establish a deeper connection to the world  as well. And see deeper truths, such as our connectedness, the beauty and meaning, underscores the subjectivity of human experience (different states lead to very different perspectives), mind-body interaction, and can lead to a symbolic interpretation.  
6. Counterfactuals: You are matter composed of particles, which are guided by an ideal.  The ideal gives the tree its essential form, and the world gives the tree its unique form.  Elementals are what maintains this balance.  
7. What is an ideal: Together, the perception of world and ideal give rise to the tree, which differs from both.  The ideal wants to observe the final result of its perception, and in doing so, it learns of the world.  Likewise, the world wants to learn of the ideal, and it does so through the tree.  
8. What we learn in seeing this way: Seeing you properly strengthens your bonds to the ideal; otherwise we weaken it; it sheds light on my motive, thus I can better adjust myself. 
9. Soul vs. Concepts: in things, we experience material forms (ideals), and in concepts / ideas, we experience immaterial forms (they have no physical substance).
10. Concepts vs. Angels: Besides concepts/ideas, there is another kind of immaterial.  Concepts are images extracted from the form of another, constructs, and seem to lack intrinsic existence, a medium of understanding, and primarily exist as images in our minds?  However, another such form does have intrinsic existence and agency and intellect (they can product more concepts), created by God (as opposed to being reflected by form), they have their own purpose in light of god’s will and unfolding of the material world.   Humans are to minerals/bacteria (viral), as Angels are to concepts/ideas/thought forms/egregores..  
11. What all of these have in common? Material-dependent forms (matter+form) & pure forms (essence + existence).  Material forms range from seemingly inert particles to humans; immaterial forms range from concepts as mere mental representations to thought forms that have assumed a degree of agency & intelligence, to angels that traffic in metaphysical truths & transcendentals.   
12. This creates a hierarchy of increasing depth and complexity, better expressing the infinity of god.  As beings are ranked higher, their mode of knowing changes (from dull, to mediated, to immediate).  Their role changes (from being, to learning from material being and cultivating virtues, to learning from immaterial being and contributing to being).  All participate in cosmic order and in the common attributes of the transcendentals that derive from the divine source. 
13. Transcendentals - The good, true, and beautiful (and being) that inform all things, both angelic and human.  The transcendentals are the reflected essences of god.  These are foundational attributes that apply to all things. But they don’t address specific metaphysical questions.
14. Transcendentals lay the foundation for understanding reality.  They serve as a framework that informs our understanding of reality, including metaphysical truths, but inquiry into these truths are a different matter.  These are specific inquiries about the nature of reality, existence, causation, the divine existence, soul nature, reality/appearance, time/eternity, unity/multiplicity, essence/existence. 

1. Monad: Monad unfolds in stages - where do TO fit into this?
2. Cosmic Order 1: you point to concepts that are warm
3. CO 2: you point to rhythms of natural order.
4. CO 3: you point to world around you.

ARGUMENTS (contingency)
1. If a thing is potentially moving and actually resting, it can only be raised to movement by something not identical to itself that is already moving.  This actual movement triggers the actual in the potential thing.
2. What are some possible efficient causes? A person pushes me.  Gravity pushes me down.  My muscles carry me across the floor (muscles are not the same as a body).  Some of these are external and others internal.  The focus here is on per se relations rather than accidental relations (such as my decision to or the force of my will to walk).    
3. What causes a person to push me? Their muscles, which brings us back to third point.
4. What causes gravity to exist? Gravity is a principle of nature. 
5. (First way). What causes my muscles to move?life ^ fuel ^ neural activity involving biochemical processes governed by physical and chemical laws, such as electromagnetism and quantum mechanics, whose existence is a contingency, which raises the question of why these laws exists and are ordered as they are.  None of these are possible if they don’t exist.  A contingent object leads to the concept of necessary and uncaused being. Such a being provides the foundation for all existence and causation. This sustaining presence is the source of all things, including my walking.
6. Second way - the person’s walking is a contingent event that requires an explanation; the person’s actions are not necessary and could have been otherwise;  they depend on other factors like the person’s will and physical abilities.  These factors raise questions about why they exist and are ordered as they are. They are contingent and point to a necessary being that doesn’t depend on anything else, which is the foundation of contingent actions.  
7. Knowledge involves that we accept a statement that is true and we have a reason for accepting it. It is related to truth as a statement, and to goodness as a desire. 
8. We desire the good (theory 3) and we want to learn more as a result.

Contingency

A ball hits B. 

1. Per Accident (temporal) -  incidental (non-major role); contingent(variable-may/not be present) elements that change the balls speed or angle, but B’s movement remains.  
2. If I move, the fact of my decision to move is incidental to the actual movement.   
3. Two people meet, but the place, of their meeting is incidental.   
4. Direct/Per se (in itself).  the inherent / essential properties or abilities that enable the interaction (these are invariable).  Necessary.  - exist regardless of time / circumstances.  
5. flame has its source in oxygen.  If you remove the oxygen, the flame goes away.  The flame requires oxygen. Parent-child relation is a per se one because it’s based on their inherent roles.  
6. A has mass / velocity that transfers its momentum to B vs the incidental aspects, such as the angle and specific dynamics of collision
7. Person moves ball with stick: 
8. Inherent: person’s intention, muscular movement, stick’s design enable the transfer of force. 
9. Incidental: act of moving the stick, direct and force applied, the resistance of the surface…. 


Glossary

1. Transcendentals: thing, one, true, good, beauty. beauty itself as coextensive with being. Transcendentals are universal and fundamental properties / qualities that apply to all beings and realities.  They help us understand the nature of reality and the characteristics that are common to everything that exists.  These are aspects of god’s nature.  T’s are the very essence of god.  God it not simply a being, but rather the being itself/source of all being.  Being as a T refers to the fact that everything that exsists derives its existence from god. Truth emanates from god’s perfect knowledge and goodness reflects his inherent moral perfection.  They are intrinsically connection.  They are inherent to god’s nature. God’s nature is the source / archetype pe of theses T.  All beings participate in being, truth and goodness to varying degrees.
2. Angels - purely spiritual beings with intellect and will.  They possess knowledge and free will, and their primary purpose is to serve God and carry out divine tasks. Angels’ knowledge is not acquired through sensory experiences or reasoning but is intuitive and immediate, which aligns with the nature of transcendentals as universal and inherent principles. Angels’ inherent understanding of the transcendentals contributes to their ability to serve as intermediaries between God and creation.

Soul / humanity

soul - the individual, spiritual principle that animates and gives life to a particular human being. The soul is the form of the body, meaning it gives the body its specific structure, functions, and capacities. It is the source of the body's vital functions, consciousness, intellect, will, and moral agency. The soul is immaterial and immortal, and it retains its individual identity beyond the physical death of the body.

Humanity, or human nature, refers to the essence shared by all human beings. It encompasses the fundamental attributes that define what it means to be human—qualities such as rationality, self-awareness, moral agency, and the capacity for intellectual and moral development. Humanity is what unites all individual humans as members of the same species and grants them a common nature.

The relationship between the soul and humanity in Aquinas' thought can be understood as follows:

- **Soul as the Principle of Humanity:** The individual soul is the animating principle that brings forth the attributes of humanity in a particular human being. It is through the soul's faculties—such as intellect and will—that the individual embodies the essential qualities of humanity.

- **Unity of Soul and Body:** Aquinas emphasizes the unity of the soul and the body. The soul is not a separate entity trapped within the body, but rather it functions in union with the body. This union allows the soul to express its intellectual, volitional, and moral capacities through the physical medium of the body.

- **Unique Expression of Humanity:** While humanity is shared by all individuals, each soul's expression of humanity is unique due to the individual differences in experiences, choices, and personal attributes. The soul is the locus of an individual's consciousness, personality, and moral character.

In summary, Aquinas distinguishes between the soul as the individual, spiritual principle and humanity as the shared essence of being human. The soul is the vital and spiritual element that animates the body and expresses the qualities of humanity through individual experiences and choices. 

The relationship between the soul and humanity highlights the unity of the individual with the broader human community while also recognizing the uniqueness of each person's expression of their essential human attributes.

——-

While the relationship between the soul, body, and humanity is complex in Thomas Aquinas' philosophy, it would not be accurate to equate the body as the "physical equivalence" of the soul. Similarly, describing the soul as an "instance" of humanity may not fully capture Aquinas' nuanced perspective. Let's break down these concepts:

**1. Soul and Body:**
In Aquinas' framework, the soul and body are distinct yet interconnected. The soul is the immaterial, spiritual principle that animates the body and provides it with its essential functions, consciousness, and capacities. The body, on the other hand, is the material component that serves as the vessel through which the soul interacts with the world.

**2. Humanity:**
Humanity refers to the shared essence that defines what it means to be human. It encompasses qualities like rationality, moral agency, self-awareness, and the capacity for intellectual and moral development. All individual human beings possess this shared humanity.

**3. Soul as an Instance of Humanity:**
Characterizing the soul as an "instance" of humanity might not capture the full depth of Aquinas' philosophy. The soul is an individual, spiritual principle that carries within it the attributes of humanity. It is the specific form that gives each human being its distinct identity and animates the body in a way that allows for consciousness and moral agency.

**4. Body as the Physical Equivalence of a Soul:**
Describing the body as the "physical equivalence" of a soul could be misleading. While the body is interconnected with the soul and plays a crucial role in the human experience, the soul and body are not equivalents in a strict sense. The soul possesses spiritual attributes that go beyond the physical realm, while the body is a material entity subject to the laws of the physical world.

In Aquinas' thought, the soul is the animating principle that brings life to the body and expresses the qualities of humanity. The body, as a material entity, serves as the medium through which the soul interacts with the world. The relationship between the soul, body, and humanity is intricate and reflects Aquinas' understanding of the unity of the human person within a metaphysical and theological context.
