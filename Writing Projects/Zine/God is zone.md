# God is zone


Existence / subjectivity
Intelligence / difference
Love / community

The world exists and so we first ask from where did it come and we intuit from what is uncreated unborn.  

The unborn has these qualities

It exists in a higher mode 
It knows and love in a mode that defines our own

It made us in our image.  If there is live there is remote resemblance.  Remote in that is is uncreated to our created.   And yet creation implied existence as resemblance.
