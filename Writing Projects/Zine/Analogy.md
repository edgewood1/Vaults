Emotion as a field
Whose state a response to perception.  

A category of concept occurs outside this field which can control both the fields and the acts that arise from it

Who is the controller?  Or
Is this a wild sea which is the sum total of parts reacting to one another.  

Concepts as particles that ripple across this state of emotion.  

Perception as the synthesis of a sensations into images to which  degrees of sympathy are attached.   These are stored in a memory field.  

Volition or will is **the cognitive process by which an individual decides on and commits to a particular course of action**. It is defined as purposive striving and is one of the primary human psychological functions.

Modern psychologists suggest that the weakness of will may be due to one or more of the following: **A lack of suitable goals**. A lack of suitable ideals and standards. Indecision brought about by one's attention shifting from one opinion or course of action to another.

Goal is a mental image.  
- instinct / sympathy current. To present images.  
- Urge / memory of instinct past is etheric. 
- Desire - imagination - perceptual.  Present past future images is astral
- Ideals.  Conceptual


When we relate will impulses to the four human *members or bodily sheaths, increasing levels of conscious awareness give the following sequence: at the physical level will appears as instinct; at the level of the *etheric body it appears as urge; at the level of the *astral body, it appears as desire; and at the level of the *‘I’ the will appears as wish, motivation and ideal. When we know which member a certain will impulse originates from, we are better placed to evaluate and regulate it.

Be the way inner and outer fields cross.  

Will could be a field that is closest to physical thru which we perceive.

Maybe ego is a field and memory is tied with emotion and concepts are ripples in astral and emotional.  Since we talk about
