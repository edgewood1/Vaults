Physical Description of tree

Map of mind / soul (Aquinas)

Could I give a scientific account vs. a goethean account.  

When a light rays bounce off a tree, the tree changes the properties of the rays, which are conveyed to the eye, which translates into an image. 

A common sense integrates sensation from various senses in order to create a coherent reflection of the world.  

- I sense you (seeing)
- Estimation > I appreciate you (feeling)
- I’m curious about you (thinking)
- I’m moved by you (willing) 

I can turn in.

Imagination + wholeness

We can talk about the whole tree, and its different parts, each part differentiated by different sets of cells, each set of cells defined by a unique reading of a version of a singular text. 


Can we talk about a tree and its parts? What would these parts consist of? Roots, trunk, leaves? Sap runs through all three.   Trunk consists of core, inner, outer bark.  Bark consists of cells, as does the whole tree - granted each cell is different.  

Cells > DNA > organic > inorganic compounds > elements > atoms > particles / fields > resolved in dimensional limits. 

These particles obey laws very distinct from those objected by in/organic compounds.  The resolution assumes higher dimensions. 

The story of flatland. 

The second dimension consists of a singular plane which which moves 2 dimensional creatures which percieve one another as dots that might extend to lines.     Through this plane, there moved a 3D sphere, however, it was only percieved as a line that extended as the sphere penetrated the sphere, but then shrunk as it left.  The 2D creatures could never percieve the whole of the sphere, but only the sliver that presently intersected with their world.  

The story of Plato’s cave. 

A group were chained inside a cave, forced to see a shadow play on a wall.  For them, this was the whole of reality, and they found great value in interpreting these shadows.   One day, one of the bound folk escaped, and in running out, saw that the shadows he took for reality were actually cast by a people who moved to / fro a fire that burned toward the entrance.  The world he knew actually had a life deeper than his own.  Furthermore, he escaped the cave, and found a sun that outshone the cave-fire, and he found a world that of which the shadow cave was mere shadow.  

The story of our world.  

Thoughts are mere shadows cast by higher creatures, present in another world. 

The objects of our world represent an unfolding of archetypes, present in this other world. 

How does a tree arise from this field? 

This tree is a dynamic form, always changing.

Beneath this changing form, Goethe discerned an underlying ur-form that guides the direction of these parts, virtual image that "emerges and re-emerges from the interaction of experience and ideas".

This ur-form can be seen.  

Through analysis, which uses the sense organ that is the brain, we discern the receding parts of the tree.  However, analysis is best applied to inert nature.  Through the capacity of [noetic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noetic) ideation, using a different organ, through an act of creative imagination, "the living imaginal beholding of Nature", one sees(*natura naturans*, the activity of "nature naturing" – as distinguished from *natura naturata*, "nature natured", the domain of naturally formed *objects*), and this dynamic nature, in constant flux and flow, but nonetheless governed by law, logic and intelligence above the mind.

Atomic vs sub-atomic world
Binding theory assumes multi-dimensions.
A 3D sphere penetrating a 2D plane would be percieved as a line by 2D inhabitants. 
A 4D hyper-tree penetrating a 3D cube would be perceived as a tree by 3D inhabitants.
A 4D hyper-object would contain every stage of the tree; it would be an information object.  Immaterial. 
It contains information about its place / time as well, since maybe it contains these inside itself. 
How is this related to divination.
This object is co-created.  While we have a death-date based on karma, it can be changed based on our choices today.

When it reaches a certain temperature, a body will emit thermal electro-magnetic radiation.  A portion of this is visible light, other portions are infrared.   

Various kinds of light rays (radiation, or energy)

What are the 7 types of rays?

The ray has different properties depending on its wavelength - x-ray, visible light, radio waves.  

Harmony and the elementals. 

The hyper-tree exists in a space that counteracts and maintains material space. 

Space itself contains particles that have counterparts in counter-space - these counter-particles are called elementals.  The nature of elementals is multiplicity.  They are united by elementary spirits + group souls.  These are detachments of angelic forces, but some from human immorality. 

These are harmonized spaces

Contemplating these might instill internal harmony

The lower astral is called the etheric. It consists of detachments from both the angelic and the human from below.   

Detachment are like rays flowing down from the angelic forces, carrying intent.

What are the angelic forces unfolding down a chain of being.

Material-etheric world

There’s our material world and our opinions about what this world is.  

There’s the world of becoming / forming

There’s the world of forms

There’s the world of void

There’s the world of existence. 

Existence draws in its breath and creates a space (void) marked by heat intelligence.  This heat intelligence is radiating light, so close to its source that beings can’t perceive their own existence.  Here, the atttributes of god are delineated.  Atziluth 

This space transforms into air intelligence and from this emerge the attributes of existence (forms);   These forms are agents / mediators of light.  Souls exist here? These arise from the void.  These beings are aware fo their distance to god / lack shape - form.   // Beriah

Air-space transform into liquid-space, enabling these forms to arise more complex expressions.  (Becoming) light assumes specific form and emotional power driven by division from god, yearning.   World of form or astral? // Yetzirah

Air space transforms to space as we know it.   Here, these complexes are felt as unfolding rays of intention, many of which concretize into material particles and energy.  Creation is complete, differentiation assumes a material form.   Divine vitality is concealed.  Present as elementals / elementary sprits?  This is divided between spiritual and material aspects. This is split between the astral / physical.   // 

If this final form of space is known as space-proper, the previous is known as counter space.  

Between the two spaces there evolves material existence, first as violent heat, then cooling into seperate gas clouds,  then suns, then their hardened offshoots.  

MATTER - where did i read that animals came first? 

Pathway 1: mineral > plant > animal > human

1. Chemical world - gycolysis / chemical conversions leading to RNA-replicating units
2. Photosynthesis (make their own food)
3. Aerobic respiration which converts O2 to sugar.
	1. Prokaryotic bacteria
	2. Eukaryotic 
	3. Corals actually are animals because they eat from world
	4.  
	5. \ 
The human existed in all these forms.  To be human was to see a second world based on the first.  Initially, a hazy world of opinion - the etheric/emotion.  But then more deeply, to the world of ideas, forms, and even the great void beyond that contained the delineations of his attributes.  To sustain these movements.   To bring them to the world, and transform the world into the lingering memories of such moments.

The earth survives the physical heat death, and arises in the next dimension - air-space, moving closer and closer towards that which calls it. 

8 Great Attractor

Substance / description of a thing
1. Formal cause - eidos means idea, image, seeing (vedas). The pattern which when present makes matter into a particular type of shape of thing.  The structure of a material thing (so it’s aligned with material cause).  Formal and material cause are fulfilled by efficient cause.  implies that conditions can be caused by things in the future.  
2. Material cause - the matter from which a thing is made

1. Efficient cause - “the maker” - prior conditions, entities, or events considered to cause the thing.  leads to the final cause, which refers to future conditions entities or events.  which is the true first principle of a thing. The fullest understanding of knowledge.  This is what a thing is for - its function.  (Alone, ts easy to imagine a temporally asymmetric sequence of events where causes precede effects in time). We can predict from past to present 
2. Final cause - “the effect” - future conditions, entities, or events regarded as cause.  (Rejected by Spinoza bc efficient deemed sufficient).  Finality thus understood is not purpose but that end towards which a thing is ordered.[30] When a match is rubbed against the side of a matchbox, the effect is not the appearance of an elephant or the sounding of a drum, but fire.[31] The effect is not arbitrary because the match is ordered towards the end of fire[32] which is realized through efficient causes.  Ie TELEOS.  We can predict from future to present. 
3. Specimens of a given species undergo a series of developmental changes.   An acorn sprouts and grows into a huge oak.  This oak is its Teleos.  At the end of this series, there exists a THING.  (TELEOS).  Is teleos a thing or a function?  Because teleos (or end-goal) exists, nature has regularity.  Acorns always strive to become oaks, baby cats grow to be adult cats.  This counters the tendency to chance and randomness.   The idea that events are caused by conditions in the future, that events might be pulled by the future from the past.

Essence - 

Whole is greater than the parts

9 history of great attractor. Story of reflection

Triangle of perception.  

1. Essence is aware (being)
2. Essence knows what it’s aware of (knowledge)
3. It enacts what it knows.   (Will / creation)

Memory I - 

Human appears as fire
X departs, and human appears as fire-air
Y departs, and human appears as plant? 
Z departs, and human appears as human

We were one
We rejected the animal
Then we were seperated
Finally, the mineral appeared

Memory II - Physical evolution

Human appears as mineral
Mineral departs and Human appears as animal
Plant departs, and human continues as animal
Animal departs, and human continues as human.
