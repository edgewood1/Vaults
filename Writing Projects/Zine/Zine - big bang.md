# Zine - big bang


CMB is landmark evidence of the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory) for the origin of the universe. In the Big Bang [cosmological models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_model), during the earliest periods, the universe was filled with an [opaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)) fog of dense, hot [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)) of [sub-atomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-atomic_particle). As the universe expanded, this plasma cooled to the point where protons and electrons combined to form neutral atoms of mostly hydrogen. Unlike the plasma, these atoms could not scatter thermal radiation by [Thomson scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering), and so the universe became transparent.[4] Known as the [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)) epoch, this [decoupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_(cosmology)) event released [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons) to travel freely through space – sometimes referred to as *relic radiation*.[1] However, the photons have grown less [energetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_energy) due to the [cosmological redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_redshift) associated with the [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe). The *[surface of last scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_last_scattering)* refers to a shell at the right distance in space so photons are now received that were originally emitted at the time of decoupling.[5
