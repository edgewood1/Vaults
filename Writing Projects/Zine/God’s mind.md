# God’s mind


**It’s likely both/and.  God’s mind is knowable** ***analogically and partially*** **through the study of nature, because nature is both a finitely patterned after His ideas and is continuously sustained in existence by His actualizing power.  But our knowledge of God derived from nature remains limited, as the infinite Creator transcends His finite creation.**
