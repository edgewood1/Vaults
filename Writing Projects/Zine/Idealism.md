# Idealism


something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality

1. Our own experience shows that the mental does inform the physical.  Knowledge can help us see more deeply.  Intense emotion can aggravate or soothe our physical bodies. Sympathy can prove healing to others.  Free will shows that we are Not determined by our circumstance
2. Argument from motion.   Moved objects are moved from without by another moved object.  This process must start with an unmoved mover.  An unmoved mover cannot be matter or energy because these two items are always under the influence of their environment.
