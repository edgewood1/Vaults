# Mineral rationality


EMBODIMENT

Rather than transcend the physical, it embodies the physical.  

I creates abstractions of the physical, and live in these abstraction, and thus am pulled between the forces of two worlds: the abstract and the physical.  

Minerals only live in one world: the physical, and are utterly faithful to its rules.  

ALIENATION

Because we are torn between two world, we live in incomplete / distorted interpretations, although we are capable of seeing through this

COMMUNALISM

I organize abstractions into 
- narratives (why not some other form?)
- That are self centered (why not something other here)?

Nonangelic things
Each an Instance of an essence; one essence of humanity.
-each instance attempts to be its own essence (like an angel)
- the mineral acknowledges is is an instance of essence, and thus has a communal acceptance.

Angelic
One instance of an essence; many essences. 

COUNTERPOINT

If essence is itself an instance of a divine idea - we can say that minerals find themselves in a similar predicament to humanity, as are angels.  There ar eonly degrees of alienation from the beatitude.

Divine idea + act > essence + act > immaterial form

Divine idea + act > essence + act > material form + mater > physical being
