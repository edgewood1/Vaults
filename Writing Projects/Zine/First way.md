# First way


First way

Your observation is accurate. The First Way, also known as the Argument from Motion, relies on the premise that everything that is in motion is put into motion by something else. This premise is based on the Aristotelian understanding of motion as a change from potentiality to actuality, where an external cause is required to actualize a potential state.

However, as you rightly point out, living agents, including humans, can initiate their own movements. This seems to contradict the premise of the First Way. Aquinas himself was aware of this objection and addressed it by distinguishing between different types of motion:

1. **Local Motion:** The First Way specifically refers to local motion, which is a change in physical location from one place to another. Aquinas argued that in local motion, external causes are required to move something from one place to another.

2. **Self-Motion (Change of Quality):** While living agents can initiate movements, Aquinas believed that self-motion was primarily related to changes of quality, such as changes within living beings themselves. For example, a person's decision to raise their hand involves self-motion in the sense that the decision originates within the person and leads to the movement of the hand.

In Aquinas' view, the distinction between local motion and self-motion is crucial. He maintained that the First Way's premise applies specifically to local motion, where an external source is required to change a being's place. Self-motion, such as a living agent initiating a change within itself, involves a different type of causality related to changes in quality rather than local motion.

In summary, while the objection you raised is valid, Aquinas' response rests on the distinction between local motion and self-motion. The First Way addresses external causes for local motion, while self-motion involves changes of quality initiated by living agents. This distinction allows Aquinas to maintain his argument for an unmoved mover that applies specifically to local motion.

Can you elaborate on the difference between these two kinds of motion in light of a human raising her hand?

Certainly! Let's delve into the difference between local motion and self-motion using the example of a human raising her hand:

1. **Local Motion:**
Local motion refers to a change in physical location from one place to another. In the context of local motion, Aquinas' First Way posits that everything that is in motion or changes its location is put into motion by something else. This external mover is required to transfer the object from one place to another.

For example, imagine a person moving from one room to another. In this case, the person's physical location is changing, and this change requires an external cause—a force or energy—to initiate the movement. Aquinas' argument focuses on this type of motion, emphasizing the need for an unmoved mover to explain the initiation of local motion.

2. **Self-Motion (Change of Quality):**
Self-motion, as described by Aquinas, involves changes within a being that do not necessarily entail changes in location but rather pertain to changes in quality or state. A common example is a living agent initiating a change within itself without changing its physical location.

Consider the example of a person raising her hand. This action involves self-motion in the sense that the person's decision and willpower drive the movement of the hand. The change in quality here is the movement of the hand from a lower position to a raised position. In this case, the person's willpower acts as the internal cause that brings about the change, as opposed to an external force or mover.

In summary, the difference between local motion and self-motion lies in the nature of the change that is occurring. Local motion involves changes in physical location, requiring external causes to initiate the movement. Self-motion, on the other hand, involves changes in quality or state initiated by an internal cause, such as a living agent's decision or will. Aquinas' argument focuses on the need for an external unmoved mover to explain the initiation of local motion, while acknowledging that self-motion operates differently and involves internal causation within living agents.

But isn’t raising the hand a change of location for the hand?

You are correct, and I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. Raising one's hand does indeed involve a change in location for the hand. I appreciate your patience, and I'll clarify the distinction between local motion and self-motion in light of this example:

**Raising the Hand as Local Motion:**
Raising one's hand is a form of local motion, as it involves a change in the physical location of the hand from a lower position to a higher position. In the context of Aquinas' First Way, which focuses on local motion, this action would fall under the category of motion that requires an external cause to initiate the movement.

**Self-Motion and Change of Quality:**
In the case of self-motion, Aquinas primarily referred to changes within a being that are not directly related to changes in location but rather involve changes in quality, state, or position within the being itself. This might include changes in the body, emotions, thoughts, or decisions.

To address your original point, the example of raising one's hand indeed involves local motion—change in location. It doesn't fit precisely within Aquinas' notion of self-motion as changes in quality. Therefore, when considering the First Way in light of this example, the question of self-motion versus local motion might not be directly applicable.

Thank you for clarifying, and I apologize for any confusion caused in my earlier responses. If you have further questions or topics you'd like to explore, please feel free to ask!

Are you saying when my hand moves up into the air, this isn’t entirely dependent on my decision, and so can’t be described as self-motion.  That the decision itself is merely a change in quality (in myself) which is incidentally related to the raising of my hand, which actually depends on other factors, such as the absence of obstructions and the presence of energy and ability?


Yes, you've accurately captured the essence of the distinction. When it comes to the example of raising your hand, the action involves a combination of factors, and Aquinas' concept of self-motion and external causes comes into play.

1. **Decision and Will as Change in Quality:**
Your decision and willpower to raise your hand can indeed be seen as a change in quality within yourself. This change in quality pertains to your internal mental state, intention, and the conscious choice you make to initiate the action of raising your hand.

2. **Physical Movement (Local Motion):**
The physical movement of your hand from a lower position to a higher position involves local motion—a change in the physical location of your hand. This local motion is contingent on a variety of factors, including the absence of obstructions, the presence of energy and ability in your muscles, and the coordination of neural signals to execute the movement.

3. **External Factors and Self-Causation:**
In the context of Aquinas' philosophy, the concept of self-motion can involve internal causation, such as your conscious decision to move your hand. However, the actual physical movement of your hand relies on various external factors, including the absence of obstacles and the functioning of your muscles and nervous system.

In Aquinas' framework, self-motion refers to internal causation within a being for certain changes in quality, but the physical execution of actions often involves external factors and local motion. The example of raising your hand illustrates the interplay between your decision, the change in quality within yourself, and the external factors required to manifest that decision as physical motion.

In summary, your understanding is correct: while your decision to raise your hand represents a change in quality within yourself, the actual physical movement of your hand involves external factors, local motion, and a combination of internal and external causes. This example highlights the nuanced relationship between self-motion, local motion, and external causes within Aquinas' philosophical framework.

Aquinas' argument for a metaphysical "first cause" in the First Way involves a transition from the chain of physical causes to the concept of an unmoved mover that serves as the ultimate cause of all motion. This transition is not a sudden leap but rather a philosophical inference based on the premises he establishes in the argument. Let's break down how this transition occurs:

**1. Observing a Chain of Physical Causes:**
Aquinas begins the First Way by observing that things in the natural world are in motion and that this motion is caused by other things. He argues that whatever is in motion is moved by another. This creates a chain of causes where each object's motion is traced back to a preceding cause.

**2. The Problem of Infinite Regression:**
Aquinas raises a question: Can this chain of physical causes regress infinitely? He contends that it cannot. An infinite regress of causes would mean that there is no ultimate source or origin of motion. This would render the entire chain of motion unintelligible and lacking a foundational cause.

**3. Necessity of an Unmoved Mover:**
Aquinas argues that the chain of motion must have a starting point, a cause that initiates motion without itself being moved by another. He refers to this starting point as the "unmoved mover." This unmoved mover is not subject to the chain of physical causes and is itself the source of motion for the entire chain.

**4. Attributes of the Unmoved Mover:**
Aquinas proceeds to establish certain attributes of the unmoved mover. He describes it as a necessary being, unchanging, pure actuality, and the ultimate cause of all motion and existence. This unmoved mover, in Aquinas' thought, aligns with the concept of God as the ultimate metaphysical source.

**5. Transition to Metaphysical First Cause:**
The transition to a metaphysical "first cause" occurs as Aquinas argues that the chain of physical causes requires a foundational, uncaused cause—a cause that exists beyond the realm of physicality and is the source of all motion and being. This transition is not arbitrary; it's a logical inference from the premises he establishes and the need to avoid infinite regression.

In summary, Aquinas' transition from discussing physical causes to positing a metaphysical "first cause" is a carefully reasoned argument that addresses the limitations of infinite regression and the need for an ultimate source of motion. While the First Way begins with observations about the physical world, the argument progresses to a broader philosophical consideration of the nature of causality and the metaphysical foundation of existence.
