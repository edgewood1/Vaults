# Philo of mind


Expistemological

The best explanation is the hypothesis that eternal objects correspond to perceptual experience. 
We constantly confirm this.
Simplest hypothesis the best - o cam’s razor. 
Thus, physical world exists outside of mind.  

Metaphysical
Are the world / mind different kinds of things? 
Qualia - our experience of reality
We don’t experience chaos parts but a coherent and unified picture, and we are aware of it, able to think about it, find meaning in it, thus, it has intentionality, pictures are something represent something else.  
We’re presented with a certain point of view of reality that reflects me
Is reality a colorless odorless objective world of science outside no pov? 

We are ruled by dreams, so our senses are unreliable
But what if waking life were a dream fed to us? 
What we know can’t come from senses alone
Senses are feeble; if we know it must come from elsewhere - reason. 
How? 
If i dream, i must exist to dream it
If i worry about it, i must think, and must exist. 
I exist because i worry about my dream state. 

Solipsism - i alone exist
Realist - world exists apart
Indirect realism - what we know about the world is content of our mind, which can represent the physical world; we can’t see the thing itself; we can’t know its reality through mere abstraction; we need an independent source.  When i experience a book, i can assume the thing creating the experience is a book, though i see a perceptual reperressentaiton.  

Problem - we can’t progress beyond skepticism. 

D’s indirect realist account is not common sense but his dualism isn’t.

Body - extended thing that has properties of length width

Mind - thinking thing devoid of these properties governed by reason
Substance - exists on its own
Property / attribute - can’t exist apart from a sub that has it
Substance dualism - a person is a soul that excretes body - ghost in the machine
Yet he actually sees them working 
The two parts create a third - sensation is the experience of the third
Sensation is the combination of thinking and doing

Light - EM radiation / fucutations of EM field / energy itself // mind- spirit / mind
Sound - energy traveling through air water matter particles // etheric // soul / heart
Touch - physical // body

To see, i require intention.  I set my self-concern aside.  What will be the object of my seeing? 

At a distance I experience it.  The space between.  The light that binds us.  Immaterial light.  Otherworld property that reveals an aspect of our world - its form, which elicits associations.

If tree interacts with its setting, it releases energy into the space which i experience as sound.  

If i assert effort and close the space between, i might touch the bark, feel its groove, the pal the bark, grooves, temperature, 


Where do these revelations occur - not in the space around or within me.  

Counterspace… anti-space

If space exerts pressure, counter exerts suction.

Matter is the result of these two spaces 

Fields?

Objects exert presssure on space / inhabited space pushes back.  

Space contains its own properties, energies, depth, intelligence working with space to enable matter. To maintain the laws that direct matter

There is something in the complexity of who we are that enables interaction.

Our complexity meets
1. Multiplicity of elementals
2. Unity of elemental spirits
3. Complexity of lower enables
4. Simplicity of higher angels / god.
