Change 

Linear  - over time
Cold coffee goes from potential cold to actual.
Must be the result of something else
Coldness in the air.
AC turns air cold

For it to change it must exist.

Coffee > water > molecules, H20

What makes it case that water exists at any moment. 

Hierarchical series - occurs in a moment

For water to exist presupposes something happening - potential particles that make up the water could constitute something other than that - what actualizes that potential.  

One level of reality depends on another.

When you follow logic, it can only terminate in something that actualizes itself.  

Esxistence of water can’t change unless something at the bottom level of reality that actualizes everything above it.  

Purely actual actualizer.  

This is aristolean proof. 

Q - change involves actualization of potential.  All actualization of potential is not change.
