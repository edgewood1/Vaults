# Spiritual implies

Metaphysical and if yr imply metaphysical you must imply a creator of the metaphysical which would imply deism. Like if you only believed in the physical there must be a physical first cause.  

Religious means to bind one’s self to the light of the other.   Spiritual means to bind one to one’s own light.  One considered convenient or comfortable. Spiritual but not religious is just a way of setting one’s self apart from those at church that one deems hypocritical.  Your grasp of the infinite is better than theirs so you refuse to share that pew.  They are petty and judgmental but you are accepting of those judge.   Except those doing the judging.  who seem to have an inferior grasp of religion. One that is judgmental.  And yet here we are judging.
