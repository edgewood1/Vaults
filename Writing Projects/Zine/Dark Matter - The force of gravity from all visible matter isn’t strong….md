Dark Matter - The force of gravity from all visible matter isn’t strong enough to keep a galaxy together, so there must be something else that has mass that we can’t see. A dark and mysterious form of matter fills out the missing parts of the equation. This invisible substance produces an attractive force (gravity) that pulls matter inward and helps hold galaxies together

Dark Energy - While matter attracts (gravity), energy, on the other hand, produces a repulsive force (antigravity) that pushes matter outward. It’s not an object but rather a property of space, and it helps explain why our universe is expanding. According to HETDEX, dark energy shows itself only on the largest cosmic scale.

Starkman and colleagues Tom Zlosnik and Pedro Ferreira of the University of Oxford are now reincarnating the ether in a new form to solve the puzzle of dark matter, the mysterious substance that was proposed to explain why galaxies seem to contain much more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. They posit an ether that is a field, rather than a substance, and which pervades space-time. "If you removed everything else in the universe, the ether would still be there," says Zlosnik. This ether field isn't to do with light, but rather is something that boosts the gravitational pull of stars and galaxies, making them seem heavier, says Starkman. It does this by increasing the flexibility of space-time itself . "We usually imagine space-time as a rubber sheet that's warped by a massive object," says Starkman. "The ether makes that rubber sheet more bendable in parts, so matter can seem to have a much bigger gravitational effect than you would expect from its weight." The team's calculations show that this ether-induced gravity boost would explain the observed high velocities of stars in galaxies, currently attributed to the presence of dark matter.
