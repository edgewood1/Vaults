Matter = “outside”
Mind = “inside”

What we know about matter
1. There are 4 kingdoms
2. There is 4 states of matter
3. This uhiverse of matter is considered to be spatial region that requires at least 4 coordinates to specify any point within it.
4. Each of these pillars of modern physics describes its respective area of inquiry — the very smallest and the most massive things in the cosmos — with astounding accuracy, but both 
5. <u>[quantum mechanics](https://www.livescience.com/33816-quantum-mechanics-explanation.html)</u> and relativity fail when applied to each other's subject matter. So far, an overarching theory of everything has eluded scientists, and some believe the ultimate goal is unrealistic. 
7. Theory of Everything attempts to reconcile these areas.   
8. [String theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) and [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory) have been proposed as theories of everything.  Both propose multi-dimensional or multi-verse 
12. lower dimensional objects can exist within higher dimensional spaces - 
13. a higher dimensional being would case a 3d shadow. 
14. immaterial domain
	1. episodic thought > stories and time leaps / memory
	2. access to insights
	3. clairvoyance
	4. not restricted by space-time-matter / can delve into the secrets of things - ot this end, it implies a higher dimension than our own.
15. string theory, one of the leading physics models of the last half century, posits hthat the universe operates with 10 dimensions. 
16. Traditions, such as the Jewish mystical discipine called Kabblah, posits 5 worlds. 
17. Hindu tets describe many dimensions.  Thh Bible describes Jacob’s ladder, and medieval Christianity has thh great chain of being, a chain of consciousness that connect material, immaterial beings to god in heirarchial order.
18. describe an angelic hierarchy 9 levels deep connecting god and earth, and can also be reduced to 3 connecting the material and teh transcendental. 
19. Could we say there are 3 states below human and 3 states above? 
20. Kaballah suggests 3 between man and god.
	1. matter - includes the pervious 3
	2. force - intellect
	3. form - achieving awareness
	4. formless - ego-death
	5. transcendent

worlds
1. atziluth - emanation / mineral / trance/ sun stage
2. beriah - creation. // formless / plant / sleep / to be aware in sleep
3. yetzirah - formation. // form / animal / dream / moon / airthe world in which moon takes place is the astral.  
4. assiah - action / waking

back
1. there are 4 kingdoms of creatures
2. each has its own state of consciousness
3. the substance of this world (physical) has 4 states 


entties - 4 states of consciousness that intervene in this landscape to create 4 kingdoms of nature that exists in a landscape that undergoes 4 states of matter, the defining substance of this world, which is embeded in 4 worlds

In the beginning, 
1. saturn consciousness dimension of pure warmth composed of mineral-man living amid higher dimensional beings. 
2. this becomes sun dimension of air composed of 2 earth-entities amid higher dimensions.  
	1. the higher beings from saturn are present here along with other ones + mineral man is bonded to saturn
3. moon 
4. earth - contains all the previous dimensions in two senses: 
	1. the entities with their states of consciousness are references to past dimensions
	2. these dimensions sitll present in the form of higher beings, also for example, the curent mineral still exists on saturn as a kind of ego

Thus, through stones, we can form a connection to saturn
Also, through its after images within us.

saturn consciousnees both evolves into sun consciousness but also remains distinct saturn consciousness.  They coexist on moon in two ways
1. saturn and sun space coexists
2. 2 creatures coexist, 1 rooted in saturn
3. higher beings from saturn continue


7 higher beings participate in saturn, they all poured themselves into the mineral.  This pouring was an act of hte imagination.  When I imagine, I project a form onto etheric space, and this space assumes the form, and enlived with enough energy, takes on a life of its own.  The same: hte mineral-human recieves the projection of higher creature to becoem something that is the wholeness of them all.  

saturn
1. mineral - human
2. angels
3. arch angels
4. archai
===
1. their astral beings
2. their devachan beings
3. their arupa beings



Evolution- intention of the human present from the start
1. mineral-man
2. plant-man, mineral-animal
3. animal-man, plant-animal, mineral-plant

1. mineral
2. plant, mineral
3. animal, plant, minera
4. man

The mineral initial contains blue print of humanity
casts of certain elements to become plant
casts off elements to become animal
