There are two aspects to realty
- reality itself
- That which participates in reality

Another
- infinity - that which has no limits - the infinite (we can ascribe ‘object’ here because ‘object’ would be to limit)
- Indefinite - that which appears to have no limit (physical / mathematical objects) - indefinite objects
- Finite - that which has limits - finite objects

Thus, 
- the indefinite and finite participate in the infinite. 
- The infinite cannot be constructed from the finite and indefinite. 

Consider JavaScript
- undefined and defined are children of null, which is the master object.
