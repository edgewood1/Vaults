God is transcendental of present absence and unthinkable. Only to be a marvel of thought.  Yet his creation is real

He obvious creation is our universe

And for humanity a correlative creation is the work of thought

Animals and plants think in terms of they make decisions as to whether to run or grow up or down.  The decision is t exeeding complex. A plant moved in the direction which most benefits its survival. Animals the same although domesticated ones extend their definition to include human sense of belonging

Humans think but they also have thoughts.  These abstract or concrete images that stand neither within or without them.  That have meaning. That map onto words and the world of objects.

Internal picture and imagery.  Some deem them a side effect of nerve firings which would imply determinism. Likewise to say it is eoiphenomenon

So these are objects independent of us.  They are used by us if we choose. We may invoke them. Or is it another whispers we invoke it.  Or are they just given to us.  However it works out it’s us ultimately that chooses them.  

They represent another world created alongside ours.  These objects are themselves what?  A concept. It is intelligent.  It contains and generates. But it is an instance that is generated.  By what.  An intelligence obviously.  An angel.  If angels generate ideas as intelligent objects might they also generate other minor intelligences that are more synonymous to forces.    These are spirits.  In our psyche we have thoughts feelings and will.  Thoughts are ideas.  Feelings arise from thoughts. Our history’s response to them. 

Feelings are like anfalse response.  We change our thoughts and the setting driving them and we change our feelings.  Will is about what we do with this pairing.  That seems more real but for so many it’s covered over by ivy

Feelings though might be like forces. Or spirits.  And thoughts are ideas.  And more often than not both arise from these intelligences as we learn to work with them.   

Angels and spirits are made of substance that parallels the physical and spacetime.  Where did they arise from.  From themselves?  Aquinas says things can’t give birth to themselves.  So another but for this other to be the original initiator it must be unique.  In what way?  

Created things exist of two things at least.  A nature essence that defines things.  So a thing is a couch if it’s flffly for sitting.  And it’s existence.  That it’s identifiable.  But unicorns are the latter.  So how do they differ from angels.
