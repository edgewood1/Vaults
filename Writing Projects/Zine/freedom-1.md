# freedom


Can’t people embrace a collectivist and individualist identity? It’s not an either/or.
 
I’m comfortable in my gender, racial, and human identity, but can respect someone who wants to explore theirs;  They have the freedom to question these values, create a dialog around that questioning, and choose for themselves. 

Typically, those who question these value systems will always be in the minority; those who respect or seek to ban others from such questioning will always be in the majority.  

This freedom is at the root of Christianity - God has granted us the freedom to choose love or reject it.  If this freedom were not present, we’d all be slaves.  

Those who seek to ban or prevent others from exploring or question “traditional” equations are ultimately seeking to enslave.
