A form is a concept

Some forms combine with matter to create material objects

Others with immaterial substance to create ideas.  

When we see a material thing there arises a corresponding concept which can give rise to ideas about that thing 

Ideas and the various perceptions of a thing are this reflections of a single convept

And while this concept seems to have a unique life, that life is bound to emit these reflections. 

Three basic aspects
Beauty reflects true perception
Good reflects true motive to drive our will
Truth reflects true concept
