Movement/Change

All things change.  One moment, the tree is swaying.  The next, it is still.  It cannot be both still and moving.  If it is still, it is potentially moving.  

A still thing can only be reduced to movement by something already moving.  since a still thing cannot be both still and moving, the thing already moving, the source of movement, must come from outside the still thing.  For example the wind could be the source of the tree’s movement.  

One could create a causal chain: what causes the wind to move? It is the fluxations of air pressure, and this from the fluctuations of heat. 

If there is no first mover that is itself unmoved, there would be no motion.  

A thing exists, but it does not actualize this potential on its own because it lacks the actualization.  So it relies on the actualized state of another. For example, a seed has the potential to grow into a tree, but it doesn’t actualize this potential on its own.  It needs to be planted in the ground and watered.  

Actuality (1st motion) in detail

Potential things are things that have the capacity to be something, but are not yet that thing. Actual things are things that are what they are.

Each member of this chain is a mixture of actualization and potency.  A thing may be actually moving and potentially still.  A thing can only be partially actualized. 

This means that they have the capacity to be more than they are. For example, a tree has the potential to grow taller and to produce more fruit. A rock has the potential to be broken into smaller pieces. A human has the potential to learn and to grow in wisdom.

How is this related to pure actuality? That which is not potential in any way.  The source of actualization.  There can only be one such thing?

A thing’s partial actuality is dependent on God's pure actuality.  A thing depends on pure actualization for their ability to be actual.  (Just like they depend on existence for their existence).   Thing’s depend on a source, a first mover. 

This dependency is a form of participation in god’s pure actuality.  However, because creatures are finite, they are limited in how much they can participate in this infinite actuality.  

In this relationship, creatures do not affect God in the same way that God affects creatures.  It is an uneven relation. 

The relationship is like that of a tree and a forest. The tree participates in the forest by being a part of it.  A tree is not actively involved in the growth of the forest. However, the tree is connected to the other trees in the forest and to the forest as a whole.  But is a forest more than the accumulation of its trees or beings?

Likewise, a river is not actively involved in the flow of water around the world. However, the river is connected to the other rivers in the world and to the water cycle as a whole. The river participates in the water cycle by being a part of it.

Difference between 1st and 2nd way

God's ability to move things without a cause for his own motion, and the other considers God's ability to cause being out of a spaceless, timeless nothingness

Everything that moves is moved by another because motion is change, and change requires cause. The cause must already be in motion.   Thus first mover.  God is unmoved because not subject to change.  And teh cause of all motion.  
Everything that exists has a cause because what has potential to exist, but does not actualize its own potential.  It needs to be actualized by another.  A first cause exists.  Uncaused because not subject otro change. 

Efficient cause (2nd way) // Existence. 

1. Nothing is the efficient cause of itself.
2. If A is the efficient cause of B, then if A is absent, so is B.
3. Efficient causes are ordered from first cause, through intermediate cause(s), to ultimate effect.
4. By (2) and (3), if there is no first cause, there cannot be any ultimate effect.
5. But there are effects.
6. Therefore there must be a first cause for all of them: God. 

Here, a thing is moved because of something else, but this does not mean that the thing that is moving is being actualized.  

A thing is not only a mixture of actuality and potentiality, but it is also an existing being.  As such a being, it is receives its existence from another - pure existence. 

Each item in this chain is also said to be real, otherwise, they could not participate in this chain.  What is the source of this existence?  A seed that sits in your hand. 

Efficient Cause: All that has a cause must have an efficient cause, which is something that brings it into being. This cannot go on forever, so there must be a first efficient cause, which Aquinas identifies as God.  (Brings it to existence).  This has to do with a thing being present.

From Contingency

Change
From moment to moment, you change.  Buds blossom, branches break and heal, acorns appear and fall away.  You reach the upper parts of the canopy.  The whole of you sways powerfully in the breeze.   

Things change, but retain their identity (ideal)
Despite the changes, you remain an oak.  That is, you aren’t suddenly an elm tree, or the moon.  (Your essence maintains you). The atoms that compose your body are not suddenly scattered across the ends of the cosmos. (Your existence maintains you).

More about the role of existence: Also, we should not take for granted the very presence of the artist, the tool, the knowledge, and the process from bing able to follow one act to the next, one moment to follow the next.   One prevents these from dissolving into nothingness? What sustains these from moment to moment?  What maintains the past as memory? Its on-going effects, and the present possibilities inherent int he future?

Chains of Dependency
You were once an acorn, and if the acorn you once were had not been viable or your surrounding soil, sun, and moisture had not been conducive, you would never have become an oak 

An endless chain of other events preceded your becoming an acorn and your surroundings becoming conducive, and if these had not occurred, you would never have become an oak.  

Infinite chain in finite time a contradiction (time unfolds horizontally and vertically)
We could trace this chain of events back infinitely.  But in doing so, we shouldn’t forget that such an “infinite” regression occur within and is defined by the fabric of space-time, which is a finite construct, and exhalation of the dark matter / energy that is continually expanding our universe from the otherworldly dimensions defined by string theory, dimensions held what maintains it - the non-temporal domain of timelessness -  absolute immutability.  How can an infinite regression exist within a finite timeline? And if time / change itself is present, what could motivate such a presence but its converse identity of timelessness. This immutability then would be a cause of a completely different order.  


Vertical time: Multi-dimensionality
The thing about other dimensions is that they are occurring simultaneous to our own, and they interact with our own dimensions.  Thus, a present event in a higher dimension is more efficacious upon our reality then events that may have occurred hundreds of years ago. (So while my ancestors may have played a role in my being here, higher dimensional activity, alongside the activity of my present dimension, very likely play a greater role). 

One thing that our dimension and higher dimensions have in common is change.  And change is about contingency, ie dependency - that is, there’s a paper trail - and this chain spins around in endless circles.  

Argument for change here

But can there only be change? If there is only change

Per se / accident relationships

Per se - Feser includes only causes that are essential and the actual agent of cause, but the standard includes all essential items that are merely necessary for the effect (ie, proximate causes like the presence of water for the water to boil).   (Earlier it said feser also included only what was present at time of cause).  Then he said that the only per se cause is a thing’s own nature, so the cause of water boiling is not the heat that is the agent, but the water’s tendency to boil when exposed to heat.   
heat and boiling water
Father and son: son could have come about by any father or any other means.  The per se cause is the genetics + environment. 

Accidental - These are non-essential causes; Feser includes accidental AND NOT incidental accidental

Accidental are  non essential and doesn’t affect the likelihood of effect
Color & cold: Color is incidental cause of cold because the color will never prevent the shirt from being cold if the climate is cold.  
Grandfather or father.  
Some S are P

Incidental are nonessential and does affect the likelihood. 
Color & warmth: color is an accidental cause to warmth of a shirt because a dark color could increase the likelihood of warmth, but not guarantee it.   
O proposition (Some S are not P)


So my grandfather is a cause of my being as well as my parents, but they are non-essential to my being.  Whether they are present or not, I am existent.  However, my essence is essential to my being.  As is the present world.  As is the world of my essence, and the multi-dimensionality that supports it. 

Per se are associated with the non-temporal or essential.  

Why must a series of essential causes have a first cause?


essential cause is one where cause is necessary for effect
These can be linked together
This must be finite by definition because it requires a first cause to initiate the series, which exists as an effect of something. 
This first cause can’t be caused by another.
Some say a first cause, by defintion, is outside the realm of causality, and thus not subject to this principle.  
Also the first cause si not an event, but a substance.  Substances are things that exist in dependent of other thins.  Events are things that happen to substances.  The first cause is not an event because it is not something that haappes to something else.   


An infinite series is one where each member is caused by a member before it.
Is a first member one that lacks a member before it (infinite) or initiatives the rest of the members (finite series)?  To be both is a contradiction.  A series either has a first member and is finite, or lacks one and is infinite.  
If an infinite series lacks a first cause, then  the series is uncaused, this would violate the principle of causality that states every event has a cause.
If each member is always caused by a prior member, and this series is infinite, then the initial “prior member” that can initiate the entire chain is never realized, which means the subsequent effect of the chain in never realized.  

Why must essential causes be finite but not nonessential?

Essential causes must have a first cause otherwise the series would be infinite.  Such causes are necessary for therir effects.  If you remove the cause, then you remove the effect. If there is no first cause, then the series of essential causes would be infinite, and as stated before, essential causes can’t be infinite.  

Nonessential series do not need a first cause because the effects in the nonessential sériese are not dependent on the causes.   For example, the color of my shirt it not essential to my coldness even though this is a nonessential cause.  So I could ask, what is a (NE) cause of my shirt color? This sort of questioning could go on infinitely.  

The first cause must be a per se cause because per accident cause is not necessary for the production of its effects.   

But why must the ultimate reason exist in the first cause? Why can’t it be itself.  Would this be like saying the universe brought itself into being?

Some philosophers argue that cosmogenesis is possible because the universe is a self-organizing system. They argue that the universe contains within itself the principles necessary for its own creation and development.

Other philosophers argue that cosmogenesis is impossible because it violates the principle of sufficient reason. They argue that everything that exists has a reason for its existence, and that the universe cannot be its own reason.

Here are some other arguments against the possibility of a finite series with a first cause:

A finite series with a first cause would be infinitely complex.
A finite series with a first cause would be infinitely old.

AQUINAS TWO WAYS

FIRST WAY: principal of causality (general, applies to all events, not just changes) ~ cosmological argument.
Every X has a cause
Causes imply causes - trace back chain
It can’t go back infinitely.  Why?
Eventually we reach a first uncaused cause.




SECOND WAY: observation of change (argument from motion)
All X changes 
X can’t change by itself; but by another. For example, a car is moved by its engine, which is moved by gasoline, which is moved by the sun.
Chain can’t go back infinitely - why?
Ultimately, Something must change it - god / a first unmoved mover.

Side note: 
If we were to ascend to these higher dimension, we would expereince “time” as “space”.  That is, we might experience the complete lifespan of a tree as a single object.
