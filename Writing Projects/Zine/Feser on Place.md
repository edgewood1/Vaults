# Feser on Place


**Aristotle on Place:**

**Bounded Cosmos and Purpose:**

* Unlike modern conceptions of infinite space, Aristotle envisioned a finite, spherical universe with Earth at its center. Each object within this cosmos had a specific **natural place** determined by its inherent properties and contributing to a harmonious order. This contrasts with modern science's focus on material causes and mathematical models, often neglecting the question of "why" objects exist and their purpose within the vastness of space.
* Examples: Stars revolving in perfect circles, fire rising towards the heavens, and a dropped stone seeking the Earth's center showcase this inherent purpose and order in motion.

**Non-Empty Space:**

* Instead of an empty void, Aristotle's space was filled with **ether**, a medium that facilitated motion and supported celestial objects. Different regions of this ether possessed distinct **qualities** like coldness or hotness, influencing how objects moved within them.
* Example: A feather's descent might be affected by the surrounding ether's temperature and "heaviness," contrasting with a heavier object's movement.

**Motion Intertwined with Space:**

* For Aristotle, motion and space were inseparable. Objects didn't simply move through empty space; they moved in relation to something else already occupying it. This "something else" could be another object, the surrounding ether, or even the object itself if it was rotating or expanding.
* Example: A projectile doesn't traverse a vacuum; it displaces air, creating a wake and interacting with the ether, which is crucial for its sustained motion.

**Feser's Further Insights:**

**Potency and Actuality:**

* Edward Feser expands on Aristotle's view by adding the concepts of **potency** and **actuality**. Objects have the potential for certain movements or transformations, which become actualized through interactions with their environment.
* Example: A seed's potential to become a plant becomes actualized through sunlight, water, and nutrients. Similarly, a stone's potential to move downward becomes actualized when dropped or pushed.

**Final Causality:**

* Beyond efficient causes (how things happen), Feser argues for **final causes** (the purpose or goal of things). Objects, in Aristotle's view, possess inherent tendencies towards their natural ends, like fire seeking its place upwards in the cosmic hierarchy.
* Example: While combustion releasing heat explains fire's upward movement (efficient cause), the final cause adds another layer of explanation, reflecting its inherent purpose within the cosmic order.

ETHER

Pt1 - transformation of ether.

Ether is not composed of atoms like our modern understanding of matter, but rather a continuously medium with varying qualities.  Imagine the malleable medium of dough through which a hand pushes through.  As the hand moves, it displaces the dough in front of its, causing it to flow around and fill the space behind the hand.  This change doesn’t involve the dough breaking down into smaller pieces, it’s more like squeezing and reshaping the existing ether.  The rock wouldn’t directly interact with the ether’s particles, but with the medium itself. 

So when an object moves, it doesn’t push through individual atoms, it would displace and transform the surrounding ether.  Imagine squeezing a ball of clay, and the clay moves, pushing and shaping the surrounding material without necessarily breaking it into smaller parts.
