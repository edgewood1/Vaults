**A. God**
Immaterial substance whose essence is existence.

**Independent immaterial** 

Immaterial substances (eg, angels) are pure forms whose essence is distinct from their existence, existing independently of matter. They are not uniform, but rather exist in a hierarchy of perfection, varying in their proximity to God, intellectual capacity, functions, and power. This hierarchical structure also mirrors the divine nature itself, with its distinct persons, and the broader concept of the Great Chain of Being.

This celestial hierarchy contrasts sharply with the realm of the damned. Fallen angels, cast out of heaven, represent a stark deviation from divine perfection. 

Among these fallen beings are demons, sometimes understood as the offspring of fallen angels and human women, or alternatively, as a distinct class of malevolent entities.   (Is this a reference to dependent immaterial objects?)

Beyond these, a broader category of evil spirits exists, encompassing a variety of malevolent forces, including ghosts, poltergeists, and spirits bound to specific places or natural elements. 
- ghosts are dead souls
- Poltergeists are? 
- Spirits are bound to places and elements?

It’s likely that a range of lower beings can also be harnessed to the ends of evil, and these range from elementals  to ideas. 

**Disembodied souls**

Human souls are immaterial substances that are the animating form of the body during life and are capable of existing independently after death, awaiting the resurrection.  However, its ultimate fate is subject to divine judgment. They are connected to a material body during life, but distinct from it. 

These disembodied souls connected to the material world through memories and experiences acquired during their embodied existence.  However, this does not make them dependent on matter or present within another soul body in the way that ideas or information on material processes.   Their existence is of a different order.

Disembodied souls exist in various states, reflecting their spiritual journey and relationship with God

"Ghosts," for example, are often considered earthbound souls, attached to the material realm. Some may be in purgatory, permitted by God to interact with the living to request prayers or convey messages. However, not all ghostly apparitions are benign; some are demonic in nature, manifestations of fallen angels or demons seeking to deceive and tempt. 

"Lost souls," often equated with those in purgatory, represent souls in a state of transition and purification, perhaps confused or disoriented as they navigate the afterlife. 

Conversely, "enlightened souls" have attained a higher spiritual understanding or union with God. Within each of these categories, souls exist in varying degrees of glory or suffering, depending on their merit, closeness to God, and the consequences of their earthly actions.

For Aquinas, souls exist in one 2 states:  the blessed and the damned. 

Blessed souls, those who died in a state of grace, having accepted God's forgiveness and love, reside in heaven. They experience a form of imperfect happiness, contemplating God indirectly through divine ideas and enjoying a foretaste of the Beatific Vision. This state of grace, achieved through allowing God's love and forgiveness to heal us, facilitates their passage to heavenly bliss. 

In stark contrast are the damned, souls of those who died in a state of mortal sin, having willfully rejected God's grace. They experience eternal separation from God and suffer the consequences of their choices in hell.

Where does purgatory fit into this?

**Dependent immaterial beings**

Other immaterial entities are dependent on the material world.  They lack independent existence and rely on material processes or substances for their being. They are forms or contents that exist *within* a substance, like a mind. 

Examples of this dependency include ideas and information.  Ideas, while immaterial, are formed through our sensory interactions with the material world. 

Without a physical world and a body to perceive it, human ideas, as we know them, would not exist. 

Information, similarly, while immaterial in its essence, relies on material media for its storage and transmission. Its meaning is independent of the physical form, but its accessibility is not.

**Thought forms**

If Ideas are fundamental, personal mental constructs shaped by experience and knowledge contained within the individual mind, and Ideologies are structured systems of beliefs, then thought-forms are like the energy that brings those blueprints to life, potentially influencing how they are interpreted and enacted

Thought-forms are complex, potentially independent entities.

They are generated and empowered (as emergent entities) by collective thought and emotion. They arise from a shared consciousness and are thought to possess a degree of agency, capable of influencing individuals and events. 

Through a kind of autopoiesis, they can achieve a temporary and contingent quasi-independent existence and influence the material world or human minds.  

This independence could also be infused through the influence of higher immaterial agents, such as fallen angels, which can use thought-forms instrumentally.  These angels can also exert a more direct influence on matter itself. 

**Composite matter**

**Exotic Materiality**

If different dimensions have different laws of physics, it's plausible that the very nature of matter could differ between them. 

Such matter would be “exotic”, possessing properties that seem impossible or contradictory from the perspective of our universe.  Such matter might have negative mass or interact through forces unknown to us. 

Different kinds of matter could interact through and be bridged by gravity.  Energy or information could also be exchanged between dimensions, potentially affecting the evolution and behavior of both universes.

**Exotic Immateriality**

Likewise, an alternative universe might be ruled by an alternative logic.

Specific mathematical structures that govern geometric shapes could differ in different universes, leading to different "flavors" of immateriality.  

The way angels or humans contemplate God and creation could vary across different universes.  Angels could have different ways of knowing and understanding, reflecting the unique immaterial structure of their respective universes. Their power and influence might also vary, as well as the nature of their hierarchy.

**Elementary matter**

elementary matter is prime matter informed by primary forms.  These forms associated with elementals, the active principles.  Elementals may have a king. 

**Prime Matter F**

pure potentiality. 

**Flat ontologies: under god we are all one.**

While beings are ordered on a hierarchy based on their degree of perfection, this system also exhibits characteristics of a "flat ontology". 

In a flat ontology, all entities are considered to exist on the same ontological level, without any inherent hierarchy or subordination. 

While a hierarchy exists among *created* beings based on their participation in God's perfection, God Himself stands apart from this hierarchy as the uncaused cause and source of all being.  His essence is identical with His existence, making Him fundamentally different from everything else.

This creates a kind of "ontological flatness" in the sense that all created beings, regardless of their position in the hierarchy, are equally *creatures*. They all derive their existence from God and are ultimately contingent upon Him. Their differences in perfection are differences in *participation*, not in their fundamental ontological status as created beings.

**Flat Ontology 2:** 

The idea that the greatest serves and supports the weakest challenges the traditional hierarchical view of creation, suggesting an ontological equality among all beings based on their common dependence on God. God's "service" to creation can be understood as His act of love in creating and sustaining the universe, providing the conditions for creatures to freely unite with Him. 

But what of a flattening within the hierarchy of creation where angels are meant to serve and aid humans, and humans are meant to serve the minerals that enabled them existence.  Is there a way in which humans enable angels? 

**Prime matter as companion of God**

The concept of prime matter partially surrounding God as an "aura of non-being" presents a unique interpretation of the relationship between God, creation, and potentiality. While this notion diverges from traditional Thomistic metaphysics, we can explore how it might be understood within that framework.

Firstly, the "exuding" of prime matter could be seen as a metaphorical description of God's initial act of creation, where He brought forth the potentiality for material beings from His own infinite being. This act doesn't imply a change in God, but rather an expression of His eternal power. Secondly, this "cloud" of prime matter wouldn't be a separate realm but rather intermingled with the material world, providing the underlying potentiality for all material substances. Finally, this concept could imply a more indirect involvement of God in the world, where His creative act establishes the conditions for existence, but the actualization of specific forms and substances occurs through the interaction of prime matter and the forms imposed by God.

In essence, this perspective suggests that prime matter, while ontologically distinct from God, is not entirely separate but rather a kind of "shadow" or "echo" of His infinite being, the ground of potentiality upon which creation unfolds. This interpretation, while unorthodox, offers a thought-provoking way to reconcile God's transcendence with His immanence in the created order.
