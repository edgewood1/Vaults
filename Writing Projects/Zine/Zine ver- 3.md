Saturn

We knew each other.  Or we knew of each other, aware of the each others presence as we lay side by side.  Of you I sensed a warmth.  It was given to us by those more gracious than us.  And this entranced laying-beside-and-untold-many, this was bliss.  We felt ourselves on the end of vast worlds to be.  

The Sun

One day, you and I were enfused with life, and we felt an irresistable draw to a light, and to keep ourselves anchored ourselves to those who had passed on life, who had maintained the old ways, the days of warmth, of warmth-entrancement.  And into these noble ones, we rooted, and we rooted because  we knew them to be as gracious as the givers of life.  

The Moon

On the day we grew apart, I was given a means to move about you, and in doing so, I saw you and the sun you strived for and the stones you anchored into.  And In me was a ravenous instinct that kept me running and devouring when possible.  

And at some point, you had made the decision not to join me, to root firm, and to see where that path might take you .  And to you, I returned to seek shelter and shade.   

Earth

At some point, the light that guided us from without began to shine out from within.  And what it shed light upon was an inner world resembling the world without.  An inner world that enabled me to over-rule the demands of the outer, at times, or even set aside the outer, or be reminded of the outer when the outer fell away.  This world I now carry within me, whose parts for which I form symbols, and to these I turn more often than I turn to you.    The symbolic, they call themselves.

SENSES

Touch - The hardness of a physical tree are bound vibrating particles. 

Sight - Image of tree are vibration conveyed by light

Sound - Sound of tree is vibration of wind against leaves and trunk.  


The Edge

But today is different, and to you I turn, and give my focus.   Others, beaten down by the world, cannot turn away from themselves and towards you.  

Because if I set aside the symbolic, and gaze long enough, what comes to me are the memories of our time together when once we shared a warmth that was everything. 

Psyche: memory, imagination, idea

In turning to you, I sense your current image.  You image binds to my imagination.  

I estimate your nature, as if my blood recognized my place alongside you, and our mutual intents.  Your nature binds to my memory.  

From nature and image arises the idea of you.  The idea of you connects you to the whole world. 

I can carry your Idea and memory, wbinds you to all other trees and to the world and cosmos.  The idea of tree.  A literal treehich inspires me to care for you, to protect you against the despots.   

But you are neither idea or memory.

As essence becomes concept and then ideas, the truth of the object becomes less abstracted.



THE WORLD

Here are two bodies: yours and mine.  We share the air between.  We are both supported by land and air bodies.  Fire rains down upon us, rising and falling in cycles, keeping time, and to this, we sleep and wake. 

What is this symmetry. 
 
DISSOLUTION

On another level, you are a particle-cloud.  

Particulate matter and energy, appearing and dissolving expressions of every point in space, superimposed fields creating a symphony of effects, music, sound. 

What orchestrates this music? But what causes change in the spatial properties, what creates and enforce the rules they follow? And how is it that we can participate in these fields?

A host of monads, elementals. 


Monad - smallest component of life.  
I have a monad, whihc is the expression of my being in the world.  
My being is made of the events in which i can see clearly and not.  Only god knows the world at one moment.  
Each of my organs have monads.  Each organ-part has monads all the way down.  No bottom line.  

interact with others directly.  Each monad contains a reflection of the entire world within it.  

The outside is merely the unfolding of an inside; the inside is the enfolding of the outside.  The organic is the unfolding of the inorganic.  The inorganic is the enfolding of the organic. 

The astral is the unfolding of the the world of forms.   Angels are denser / more complexed / more highly defined (less free?) forms of arch angels. 

Abstractions unfold into denser more complex forms



COUNTERSPACE

There’s space as we know it, and there’s an inverse-space whose forces and elements counter those of space-as-we-know-it.

A host of monads also mark this space.

A monad is a life vector, a basal intentionality, a root creativity, an energy.  The exist at every level - from particles to people, from cells to organs, to people.

POSITIVE SPACE
 
Regular space radiates positive pressure, has energy density.  As pressure increases, does energy become dense and there’s a sense of contraction?  pushes inward.  

Matter composes 5% of this space - the rest is dark matter / dark energy. 

Dark energy is a property of space that has negative pressure, energy density, expanding universe, making it more dense (how does negative pressure expand?)

Dark Matter - shapes actual matter; leads to cosmic contraction

NEGATIVE SPACE

Beyond this space exists “negative” space.  Consider the number line - if we exist along the range of the positive integers, space is 0, and counterspace extends into the negative integers.  

| Negative                                     |                                              | How manifests                                | Order                                        |                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Negative                                     | Suction                                      | Matter                                       | Explicate                                    | Enfolding nature / deepening                 |
| Positive                                     | Pressure                                     | Thinking (negative matter / form extraction) | Implicate                                    | Unfolding nature                             |


The tree lives in me in a negative sense - as a non-material exerting negative pressure.  

Solar matter is negative; The sun is a colllection of negative pressure force.   

Mind exists within/without - deconstructs the binary.  Yet binary reconstructed by reason.

Inorganic is the inside of organic
Forms is th inside of angels
Simplicity the inside of complexity
Unity is the inside of multiplicity?

ENERGY

Counterspace is marked by radial energy, life, which feeds tangential energy of space and drives its evolution toward greater complexity and modes of information, expressed in each monad-point. 

The tangential is the realm of the mind, the within, bound to the world of matter, the two passing into each other. 

The source of this energy is the logos, whose rays are life -ether, seeds of reason, driving being and forging new hosts. 

Omegapoint  
- The endpoint of the universe; it draws all things to itself, exists at the end of (after) time.
- On-going evolution results in / spirals into a convergence, a final unification.  Elements become increasingly complex, increasingly transparent, increasingly bonded.  Organization moves from tribes to societies to civilizations.  
- OP occurs at the end of time when all sequences of existence are sucked into its being.  
- The energy that generates the OP - is this radial? He calls this forces of compression, and its generated by communication between people, which expands consciousness.  It is limitless and correlated with entropy.  
- Evolution is associated with communication, which expands consciousness.
- Is this expansion associated with forces of compression? What pulls things into the omega point
- Compression vs expansion - what’s this dynamic

Energy (inclusive life) creates waves (rhythms / time) in light (substance of space / expansion).

Development

Creatures peer into the void, the dark mirrror; the grow via reflection, yet in absorbing the peering, they become complex detachments.  

Dark mirror excludes the light of rationality.  An image that shows our dark side.  Used to communicate with higher beings.




- The subatomic represents the multiplicity of the tree’s unity.
- Counterspace, which is the substratum of space itself, contains a negative equivalent - a host of negative particles conveying radial energy (ether). 
- Counterspace composed of its own hierarchies of order: 
- These hosts are at the behest of elemental kings, who are their unification.  These kings (or princes? Or other creatures like unicorns or giants?) are what they manifest in our world - either via dreams or as etheric forms - neither physical but containing presence - a waking dream? 
- Elementals themselves detachments of higher beings: angels.  
- Elementary sprits
- Group souls
- Spirits of time
- Elementals // the forms of matter
- Group souls // the ability to transform matter - protosouls 
- Spirits of time // rhythms of the world (time)

TRANSCENDENCE

but what maintains these things - allows them to be as opposed to not be - that is what’s often overlooked. 

Void - principle of freedom
Form - essence + existence

On dying, the experiences on one lion become a common property of 100 lions.  As group soul develops, it s;its up and each group soul then incarnates in lower and lower bodies until one soul mainly manifests in one single body.  Then it becomes ready for individualization.  

Insects can have a group soul divided among millions.  Domestic animals are the opposite.  Was Egyptian relation to a cat some sort of relation that angles have towards us?

Astral
Spirits of rotation of time from H1
Group souls from H2
Etheric
Angels live in upper part of H1? 
Elementals from H1 (who live in lower h1?)

It has 3 characteristics:  of a monad
- differentiation - each part strives to be more unique, complex.  It is the part striving to be its own whole.  Consider DNA and how each map attenuates some parts over others.
- Communion - each part seeks uniqueness while maintaining a relatedness to all other parts; a common language; sympathy to the other
- Autopoesis (subjectivity / depth?) - to be a center of creativity (creation unfolding from itself). 

The principles have biological equivalents: 
- powers of mutation, 
- natural selection, 
- and niche creation
