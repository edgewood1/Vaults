# Physics



Some particles have matter, like electrons.  These exist in a field, like the EM field.  They also use a non-material particle - massless packet of energy - to carry force from one electron to another, and thus energy, which is a property of objects, is transmitted   We can say a photo carries EM force.  Actually, and this force confers energy to an object? 

These fields cross through empty space, which itself is a substance of some sort - maintained.

What maintains these fields and the space they interact. 

inertia is a force that holds the universe together, which is counteracted by heat and kinetic energy of moving articles.  

gravity keeps our universe together.  

Do photons travel along an em feield?




**A photon is a tiny particle that comprises waves of electromagnetic radiation**. As shown by Maxwell, photons are just electric fields traveling through space. Photons have no charge, no resting mass, and travel at the speed of light.

electric fields? as in multiple?
