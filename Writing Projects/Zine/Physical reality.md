All cells have the same genes.  However, how the cell reads these genes depends on its internal chemistry and external location.  The unique reading of this same script (is the script the same if some of its words are redacted?) yields differentiation.  A tree is composed of many kinds of cells: roots are composed of 5 kinds, trunks are composed of 5 kinds, and leaves are composed of 5 kinds.  Underlying all of this is a single unredacted script.   While all living forms contain a base of DNA, they differ depending on the species.

Atoms - there are different kinds - oxygen, nitrogen

Elements – These are substances containing atoms of only one type. Chemical reactions cannot break elements up into simpler substances. Examples of elements are iron (Fe), oxygen (O₂), and silicon (Si).

Compounds have more than one type of atoms connected by chemical bonds. Chemical reactions can break compounds into simpler substances. Examples of compounds are water (H₂O), and table salt (NaCl).

Mixtures – These contain two or more unbonded substances. Techniques that do not involve chemical reactions can separate mixtures. Examples of mixtures are saltwater, air, and cookie dough

Organic compounds always contain carbon. If any carbon atoms in the compound bind to hydrogen, it is organic

Organic compounds are the basis for DNA and cells, which are the basis for life. For example, the carbon cycle that includes the exchange of carbon between plants and animals in photosynthesis and cellular respiration.

Examples of organic compounds are carbohydrates, fats (lipids), proteins, and nucleic acids, which are the basis for the molecules of life. Organic compounds also include petroleum and natural gas, which are the main components of fossil fuels

A virus is made up of a DNA or RNA genome inside a protein shell called a capsid. Some viruses have an external membrane envelope

The most abundant element in the earth's crust is oxygen, found within rocks in a variety of compounds such as carbonates (CO3), sulfates (SO4) and phosphates (PO4).
Metals such as aluminum and iron are also widely found throughout the earth's crust within various compounds. For example, pyrite (fool's gold) is an iron ore in which iron is in a compound with sulfur (FeS2). Salts are another common example of minerals found in the earth. Rock salt (NaCl) is a compound occurring naturally, containing sodium(Na) and chlorine (Cl).

The air in Earth's atmosphere is made up of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen

Water H20

Light is made up of photons, tiny packets of electromagnetic radiation. These photons can be absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere, causing the molecules to have higher energy; on a larger scale, that means that the air in the atmosphere is heating up

What do all these have in common? 

Atoms are proton-electron clouds composed of subatomic particles; particles are excitations in various fields.  

There are 12 known fundamental particles that make up the universe. Each has its own unique quantum field. To these 12 particle fields the Standard Model adds four force fields, representing the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force

These fields permeate and soak up all of space and time. There is one field for each kind of particle

This is where the idea of 12 fermion fields and 12 boson fields come from. These fields are excitations of the underlying theories (the Standard Model) that describe the known Universe in its entirety … all told, there are 24 unique, fundamental excitations of quantum fields possible. This is where the “24 fields” idea comes from.
