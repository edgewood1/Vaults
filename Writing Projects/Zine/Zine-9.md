Space is actually an immaterial substance called ether

There are 3 sets of ether each one comprising 3 less divided grades. 

These grades are as removed from one another as we are from our animal brethren.  And yet we were once united with the animal and plant mineral. Only to distinguish ourselves as we shed layer in an attempt to cultivate intellect and will. 

All of creation has followed this path.  One civilization shedding its skin to progress and newer societies emerging from this shed skin

If ether is the aubstance and elementals are the force carriers or particles that move thru it.  Are elementals composing angels.   They seem to be composing us.
