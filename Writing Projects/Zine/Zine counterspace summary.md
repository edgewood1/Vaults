# Zine counterspace summary


In the fabric of reality, ordinary space consists of objects and the air that surrounds them.  

On a quantum scale, both object and air are composed of particles, which operate on a very different set of rules than do their composed counterparts. 

Two kinds of particles: material and force-carrying.  

Objects have these particles more densely and intricately packed. 

Matter emerges as interconnected nodes, bound by the forces that define their relationships.  These forces not only shape the behavior and nature of matter, but also serve as a means for its expression.  

Matter is an abstraction shaped by the underlying forces connecting it to the world.  An analogy to this might be the way our perception is an abstraction sculpted by the various forces that bind it to the surrounding world, or the way concepts abstract and are bound by perceptions.   

These particles are actualized points in a field, which is a three-dimensional array of points, with each point representing a quantity.

A point actualizes as matter or force, depending on the nature of the actualization.  
- an actualized point transforms other points into particles, or changes the nature of already existing particles (either into another kind of particle or into a non-particle.  
- This cascade of reactions creates an ever-changing, diverse/complex topology.  

However, only 5% of the mass-energy content of our un  iverse can be attributed directly to these fields, the rest is attributed to “other” dark regions, which exists as a distinct region of its own.  It interacts as (dark force) gravitational forces influencing the motion of galaxies and dark energy, accelerating the expansion of unverse.  

Dark matter and energy is attributed to more fundamental aspects of the universe, which could include counterspace.  

Counterspace can be described as the intangible dimension of space that 

- delineates less obvious connections between objects  of ordinary space.
- interweaves through / coexists with both ordinary space and quantum phenomena
- contributing a synergetic and radial influence that shapes the rhythmic patterns and growth of that within existence.

**How does counterspace interact with the world?**

Counterspace interacts with ordinary space through various mechanisms, such as membranes, which are a feature of every particle and object in existence.  

In a general sense, a membrane is a boundary that defines an object, living or not, as distinct from what it is not. 

This boundary might be synthetic or natural, apparently solid or overtly porous, physical or metaphysical.  

It can maintain and protect an internal environment, and provide selective passage for other substances.  

Even quantum particles can be said to have membrane. 

While some particle properties, like position and momentum, can’t be described with certainty, others, like spin, mass, and charge, can.  The presence of such properties define the particles as opposed to its non-particle regions, where the particle would be said to not exist.  

Membranes differentiate the inside from the outside of an object, as well as the inside from the outside of space itself (inside being an analogy for counterspace).

Membranes act as an interface for the influx/outflux of pressure, moving the object towards homestaisis, enabling synergy between the object and its context (place)  

Each object or particle has a corresponding aspect in counter-space, called “infinitudes” .  While an object has a finite nature, an infinite extends toward infinity, and thus is able to harbor all the potentials of the object as well as connect it to all other potentialities-essences-objects.  

**What is the relation between particles and objects?**

A fractal is a complex geometric pattern that repeats at different scales, exhibiting self-similarity regardless of the level of magnification.  

Infinitude’s, particles, and objects are arranged into fractals, such that an object repeats the pattern of its particle-configurations, which repeats the patterns of its infinitude.  

What occurs on one scale can affect objects in other scales, thus the idea of karma.

Whether the larger scale is emergent property of the lower depends on whether the lower is prior or more fundamental in nature than the larger.
