Sun crushes atoms to create more dense elements, then the sun explodes, releasing them, and these assemble to form

In teh sun, atomic nuclei combine due to intense heat and pressure, releasing energy in the process.
This fusion creates helium and even carbon and oxygen and iron.  Other processes (like the neutron capture the follows supernova experiences, or neutron star mergers (collisions between stars) or interactions with high-energy cosmic rays) create iron and beyond, and also release them into the universe, which are recollected by gravity to form new planets and suns.  

To become a sun, an object needs enough mass to ignite nuclear fusion in its core.  Otherwise it becomes a planet.
