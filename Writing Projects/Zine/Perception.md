# Perception


- soul receives impressions from the body
- They are fleeting - occur only as I am present to the rose.
- Concept- what i recognize in me as true about the rose; true even if i hadn’t experienced rose.
- Does not pass away; does not depend on me.  
- The concept connects soul to a universal content. 
- It connects the soul’s independent imperishable aspect (spirit) rather than its perishable bodily aspect.  
- Soul preserves present for rememberance, wresting it away from perisahability and giving it a place in the permanence of its own spiritual nature.  Through memory, the soul preserves yesterday, through action it prepares tomorrow.  
- The rose and our perception of it is temporary
- My soul retains an impression, which becomes a mental image / representation independent of external.  thus, it turns the outer world into its own inner world. As an inner object, I can continue to lead an inner life with it, independent of any impressions acquired from the past.  
- Actions also acquire permanence once stamped on the outer, having its own outer impression.
- thus the i stamps its own impressions upon an outer act, and upon its memory, an inner act. 
- When i perceive a thing, i impress upon it past memories of the thing.  And both are retained in memories - the image + the intent - together forge a perception, which becomes united to the overall life of the soul, bound by its own unique chains.  
- Our acts are preserved in the world that has its own logic of saving it, and our stamp resides with this act. 

- sense things are of the same substance as soul and spirit worlds around them, they are condensed spirit and soul formations, making possible our senses to acquire knowledge about them.  
- Like ice is one manifestation of water, sense thing is one form in which soul and spirit exists.  
- This is why i can have a thought about a sense thing.  
- Thoughts are in harmony with structure and order of nature. 
- Sense object originate in spirit, when we think, we direct away from sene form and toward their spirit archetype from which they came.  W Melt the solid body so we can study its fluid then airy forms.
