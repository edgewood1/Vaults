hey, thanks for your post.  i hear what you’re saying regarding the ‘trust the universe’ bit, but it still inspired from me a quick although long response: 

 belief is accepting that a statement is true or tha tsomething exists.

if you look at the data on global warming and think that there is in deed a correlation, then you believe in global warming. 

If you believe in god, then you accept that it is true that god exists. 

god is simply the “first-mover” - the source of existence itself - however you might imagine that. 

faith is simply belief in god; however, there are many stages of faith - one form has to do to conformity to group ideals whereas a higher form has to do with accepting the “mystery of life” and seeing sacred stories as symbols about this.

Higher Power refers to god.  It is arguable that the “earth” or the “universe” is greater than ourselves.  Just like it’s arguable that we are an insignificant blip in a vast and uncaring universe. Just like its arguable that humanity and the universe are co-creators reaching for something greater than themselves. 

But by definition, the creator of existence itself is greater than what it creates, namely us, and if someone is to be honest with him/herself, is what iis meant by the term “higher power”. 

religion is simply a cultural system, much like science is a cultural system.  Both have a set of designated beliefs, behaviors, practices, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, predictions, ethics, and organizations.  The difference: the object of inquiry in science is strictly physical, measurable phonemena, whereas religion, while allowing for the object of science (strictly physical), also opens itself to what is beyond the physical, specificially, the metaphysical. 

Yes, religion creates a space for the social expression of faith, but that is because religion define god as unconditional love, and in deference to the notion of “loving your neighbor” is the equivalent of “loving god”, it makes sense that you would commorate god, not alone, but alongside others you may or may not otherwise spend time with.  

While we have plenty of opportunities to experience our neighbors and show love and mercy (although this is often done to serve ulterior motives), it is a different experience to celebrate love / mercy with others who also value these virtues in a scenerio that is utterly non-self-serving.  

Granted, attending a worship service doesn’t necessarily mean you believe or have faith.  Many go for reasons other than this - they often go for the sake of children or for social acceptance; however, others do go in order to deepen their relationship to faith in a way that can’t be done by spending time alone on a beach for example, trapped in one’s egoism, undisturbed by one’s neighbors. 

While such alone time can be beneficial to give perspective, it can only be deepend through the additional context and insights of the traditions served by religion, much in the same way that a field scientist would want to return to the main office after he’s collected in his data in order to compare it to past and current research, hypothesis, etc.  

Sure, attending church isn’t for everyone, but it’s and we often don’t have time, but attending a simple traditional orthodox service isn’t for everyone, but it’s very for those people, who might get the most out of it, and likely have the most to offer it.  , even if done only on occassion, can offer some meaningful insight into one’s life.
