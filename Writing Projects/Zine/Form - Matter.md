Form / Matter

All physical things are a mixture of matter and form.   This doctrine is called ‘hylomorphism, itself a combination of the greek words for matter (hule), and for form ( eidos or morphe ).  Unsurprisingly, eidos also refers to the word idea, or image - the image idea, or mental image that informs and oversees a piece of matter in its becoming the material object that it becomes.  

1. overseeing form
2. matter - clay
3. object - human or animal or tree or stone

Consider the following: 

1. form: matter
2. soul: body
3. perception is the reception of form without matter
4. constitution: citizens
