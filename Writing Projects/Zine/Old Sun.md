# Old Sun


At the close of Old Saturn, there was a period of withdrawal and sleep, and the Old Sun stage commenced.  The Spirits of Wisdom, the Kyriotes, initiated the cycle by sacrificing a portion of their being.  This manifested as light ether, illuminating the cosmic expanse and carrying within it the seeds of perception and differentiation.
The warmth ether from old Saturn condensed to heat, and aspects of light ether condensed into the element of air, which introduced movement, rhythm, and the potential for inner sensation within the previously static warmth, setting the stage for the later development of  consciousness.  
The interplay of air, warmth, and light created a new atmosphere â€“ a warm, gaseous state that became known as the <u>**Lower Devachan (rupa)**</u>. This realm is characterized by the emergence of subtle forms.  
The lower devachan is the “astral in potential”.  The LD, with its focus on forms and archetypes, provides a blueprint or template upon which the astral realm will later manifest. 
The dynamic interplay of light, air, and warmth in the lower devachan stimulates the emergence of movement, rhythm, and potential for inner sensations - qualities associated with the astral. F
A side effect of this process was the emergence of electricity â€“ a force some associate with the influence of Luciferic beings.
The Archangels, in their 'human' stage of development, shaped the transformative light and air. This gave rise to the Second Elementary Kingdom (EK2), a realm of creative sound, vitality, instincts, reproduction, and the archetypes of life processes.
Inspired by EK2 and infused with the light ether, a new group emerged â€“ the collective essence of the <u>**future plant kingdom**</u>.  This plant group soul, like the mineral group soul anchored in the higher devachan, began to develop a subtle astral body. 
Meanwhile, the mineral group soul, anchored in the higher devachan, assumes an astral body.  
In the atmosphere of the light-air-warmth, the groundwork for the future etheric body took shape.   This body would become crucial fo rate expression of life forces and vitality in later stages.
