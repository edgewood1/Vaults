God is simple - no parts - one essence
God is 3 persons - 3 relational personas

Grace is the flow of God beyond itself, actualizing as essence.
God desires self to be realized outside of himself.  

God as father
Immaterial realm - spirit
Material realm - son

Immaterial realm

This realm consists of essences that are a composite of essence and existence; this differs from essence that is existence itself

What does it mean to be a composite? 
- essence participates in existence vs it is existence
- It can expereience accidents; thus
	- This essence isn’t the wholeness of existence BUT the wholeness of this particular form. 
	- This creates a being that can realize its own essence; thus, it is ever realizing aspects of its wholeness.  Can an angel know its full self at once? 
What is the difference?
God - god is existence
Angel - form of? That has existence
Human - rational animal that has existence

What are the two kinds of composition? 
Pure forms: Wholeness - current self (accident)
Composed forms: wholeness + matter 

Composed forms assume another transformation: 
Material forms: composed forms + current self (accidents)

Thus we have a 3 foldedness: 
God - angels - world

The world is composed of 3 types of soul that are fully immersed in the material realm. 
Mineral - maintains structure
Vegetative - transform structure internally
Sensitive - mobile ? 

Finally, the final type, which could be placed fully between the middle and final world.  

If the worlds of god and angel are fully rational, where god’s concepts are reflected in the angelic and materialize in the ensouled world, then the human is situated in both the material and the conceptual - unlike their earthly compatriots, they can create, like god, symbolic worlds that at times translate into the material.  

The conceptual is called mental representation  

Two aspects of the rational life
- intellect
- Will - related to intention? What i direct my attention to?  My body acts when a value surpasses a threshold defined by will? Concenctration - ability to value and maintain a value in mind, and because it thus becomes a need, my body acts accordingly.
