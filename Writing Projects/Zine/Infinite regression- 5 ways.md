# Infinite regression: 5 ways


In the context of traditional philosophical and metaphysical discussions, the concept of an infinite regression of instrumental causes is generally viewed as problematic and often raises questions about the nature of causality, explanation, and the ultimate source of effects. Let's explore this concept further:

An instrumental cause is an intermediary cause that brings about an effect by being used or employed by another cause. For example, consider a person using a stick to push a stone. The stick is the instrumental cause that mediates between the person's action and the movement of the stone.

When it comes to the question of whether there can be an infinite regression of instrumental causes, several considerations come into play:

1. **Principle of Sufficient Reason:** The principle of sufficient reason asserts that everything has a reason or cause that explains its existence or occurrence. In the case of an infinite regression of instrumental causes, one might question what ultimately explains the series of causes and effects. If each instrumental cause is only bringing about the effect due to another prior instrumental cause, it raises the question of what ultimately accounts for the entire series.

2. **Explanation and Causality:** Infinite regressions of instrumental causes can be problematic when it comes to explaining the occurrence of an effect. If every cause is dependent on another cause without an ultimate starting point, it becomes challenging to provide a satisfactory explanation for why a particular effect is happening at all.

3. **Aristotelian and Thomistic Views:** In the metaphysical frameworks of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, an infinite regression of causes was generally not accepted. They believed that there must be a first cause that initiates the chain of causation and brings about effects in the world. This first cause, according to their views, is not itself an instrumental cause but a primary cause that is uncaused and initiates causality.

In summary, while there might be differing perspectives on this topic, the concept of an infinite regression of instrumental causes is often met with philosophical challenges related to the principle of sufficient reason, the nature of causality, and the need for an ultimate source of explanation. Philosophers like Aristotle and Aquinas argued for the necessity of a first cause to avoid an infinite regress of causes and to provide a coherent framework for understanding the origins of effects.
