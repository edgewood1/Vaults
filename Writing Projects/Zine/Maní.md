1. Backyard

Describe my backyard it contains 4 kingdoms 

What’s is there?  Is the bird there?  A collection  of dis/appearing thru ‘‘em fields and if so how do these particles adhere to birdness? What governs their attractions and repulsion’s?

A bird is a collection of tightly packed atoms pierced by streams of fluid and gaseous atoms.  To this end, the resemble a landscape.



1. Perceptions 

If the bird may be an amassing of particles, I perceive in holistic terms, as the governor of these bird particles
Might have intended.    And these collected perceptions are common to the human animal nervous system. Some say there’s a gap between what is and what appears and other see these two existing on a spectrum

That is Can see the intention of invisible governors.  That we can sense via instrumentation the effects of blck matter.  What we perceive mediates between who we are and the governors.  


When I close my eyes I see the afterimage of a bird.  A sort off phantom bird.  Later I retain the memory of a bird. I consider the concept of bird an animal with wings.  This allows me to reason in lihght of non animals and other animals.  

Some birds strike us and stir emotion. Some emotion elicit impulses.  A certain quality of thoughts compel us to restraint or cultivate impulses. 

The in we world

Like the outer world the inner appears as a vastly diverse collection of objects that disappear a wide assortment of fields.  

While our bodies impact this world it seems like this world has a greater impact on the physical

==========

The inner is non physical.  It seems to obey different laws.  One more analogous to the subatomic.   Our inner world are more
Like in an inner body.   Bodies are collections of organs that exist across fields.   The comings of particles 

Much like we are blind to the quantum world.  We are blind to the fields our inner bodies exist in

We can cultivate a state of perception hat will enable us to see these fields

My inner body contains aspects of the literal bird outside us.  Our world then is ruled by larger unities aspects of which we can also sense the states of perception.

1. Physical object. It’s governors.   Over lords.  Souls.  These creatures.  Compose the world.   They all exist in states of potency.   The unity that bind them is existence.  
2. The physical. The world of embodied beings.  These correspond but latter more dense.  The overlord world. Transcendental.  These are 4 worlds.  Some traditions perceive a 5th.  Between the overloads and the transient is the formless.  The desert.  These existing fields or
3. Veils.  Upon which the over lords exist. 
4. Then detachment s and souls.   Exist as beings of greater potency
5. Then physical into which they appear


The physical exists in gradations. 4
Kingdoms each have 4 states of conscious

Human _ wake asleep in higher worlds.
Animal awake in two worlds.  The fields
Plants are
Awake in the overlords
Minerals are awake in the formless. 

The fields they are awake in mark their intelligence quality.  

While people we can never perceive as are plants we have an
Analogous sensibility

Liminal states between
Wake and sleep
Sleep and dream
Dream and trance.  

Trance is sleep walking. Numb. Carry out orders with perfection
Sleep 
Dream. 

The 4 kingdoms are analogous to 4 elements. 

Mineral solid
Plants air.  Particles super free
Animal has.  Particles freeze
Human hear. Chaos. Ñ

When I see the bird I close my eyes and contemplate afterimage.  That means I stay with it until it dies away.  These leave behind until reaoundings.   These pass and then what appears to be nothing which is apparent nothings held
By traces of bird.  And then from this an image word.  A deeper still.  A speaker.  Then. Context. Contact.  Dance. Samadhi.
