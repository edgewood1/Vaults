# Mind


Mind is a form that can become another form without losing itself. 

When my mind percieves an object, it becomes that object momentarily before allowing it to pass into memory.

When my mind percieves an object, it absorbs the form of the other. 

The cup has a form that it can convey yet maintain.

The cup will inevitably lose this form.  This form will also alter over time. 

Matter maintains this form.  

Form shapes the matter. 

Form is the intelligence of the cup.

This kind of form cannot perceive other forms?

However it can recieve forms?
