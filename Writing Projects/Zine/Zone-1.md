There’s necessary and contingent things
Contingencies go in and out of being
But a thing cannot be unless there is being
And so long as a thing exists there is being
And even if all things annihilate and yet there’s the possibility of existence then there must be being
For being is the both being and the possibility of being
There would be no possibility of being unless there was a preexisting being
That is the possibility presumes being.
