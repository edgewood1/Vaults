# Catholic v Protestantism



Sacramental form  / Analogical imagaintion.

* God is present in and through the material world. 
* Creation is teh vechicle that communicates god. 
* Because the infinite god becomes finite (via the incarnation), finite things can mediate grace.  
* Thus, it is not god OR the world - it is god in the world.  
* Thus Catholics rely on stuff - statues, rosaries, relics, incesnes as bridges to the divine
* Water of baptism isn’t teh symbol of cleansing; it fundamentally changes the ontological form of the soul - its character - soul is the reality from which arises immaterial faculties.  
* The world is an icon - a window into heaven.  


Protestantism - the dialogical imagination.  
* there is a gulf between the world and god.  
* To say a piece of bread is god is idolatrery.  
* It is god or the idol.  
* Matter doesn’t mediate. 
* God doesn’t physical inhabit material objects - 
* Islam Judaism and Gnosticism all feel the same.
