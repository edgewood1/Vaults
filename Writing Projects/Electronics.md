# Electronics



**Atoms**

Atoms consists of:
* Protons: + charge
* Electrons: - charge


Electromagnetism - the force that bind protons and electrons due to their opposing charges.  

If there are an unequal number of protons or electrons, they are called:  

Positive ion - electron loss yields negative charge
Negative ion - electron gain yields posiive charge

Atoms lose and gain electrons randomly.

What makes one element different than the next? 

Elements: copper, gold, etc

Conductors: elements where electrons jump around more easily.
Insulator: electrons are reluctant to jump around (glass, paper).

Voltage (potential difference) - difference in electric charge between two points.  This needs to exist for current to flow.
Eg: 
* one piece of metal is positively charged
* One piece is negatively charged

Connect these two pieces with a conductor, electrons flow from one piece to another.  This continues until all atoms in the circuit are electrically nuetral; then they revert to random movement.  

Voltage sources
DC - charge moves in one direction only, voltage remaining constant (batteries)
AC - charge periodically reversed (50-60 x per sec). More efficient over long distance (used in properties).

Amps is how we measure current / flow of electric charge.

Two kinds of current flow
* electro: electrons flow from negative to positive terminal 
* Conventional current flow - opposite direction.
* never connect terminals of a battery directly together as this will cause battery to overheat. 


Resistors - all components in the circuits, including wires, resist the flow of current, some more than others.  You can add up all the resistances to get the overall resistance of the circuit itself.  Resistance provided by a wire increases as length of wire increases / thickness of the wire decreases.  Resistance is measured in ohms.  Ohm’s law: 

Voltage = current (amps) x resistance (ohms). 

Power (work done by a circuit) is measured in watts.  **(Purpose of a circuit is to do work).**

Battery can be a source, and its power output carried over wires and converted into other forms of energy, such as light, heat, or motion. 

The amount of power created by a circuit depends on the amount of current passing through + amount of voltages used to push the current through.

Power = voltage (ohms) x current (amps)

A 
1 amp current pushed through a circuit by a 
1V power supply generates 
1 W of power

When circuit hooks into a light bulb, it dissipates a certain amount of power in watts.  Thus, heaters and lights are given power ratings in watts.  40 watt light bulb.  


**An electric current: a loop that starts and ends at the same point and provides a conductive path for an elective current to flow.**

A light bulb has 2 terminals (connectors) on it
* thread
* Dot
You can connect the batteries positive terminal to the side or the bottom.  

Battery supplies voltage that causes current to flow around circuit from negative to posible terminal of battery. 

Load - in this case its the light bulb.  The load is a component such as a resistor, capacitor, LED, buzzer, motor, light sensor.  (Is this something that consumes power?)

Switch - disconnects battery.  Turns circuit from closed to open. 

Short circuit - current takes an alternative route to the one you want it to, and in doing so bypasses some or all of the components of the system.  Eg, adding an extra circuit that bypasses the switch.  

A battery has a little internal resistance.  Usually 0.140.  So if we supply 1.5 V of energy, we get 10.71 amps, which is a lot of current to pass through the battery, which will lead the circuit to get hot, and the battery to explode. 

If we add another 1.5 V, the bulb will shine even brighter.  If we add more bulbs, they dim.
