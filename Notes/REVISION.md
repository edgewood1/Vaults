# REVISION


We when look at the same tree, we each experience our own tree. 

And yet there’s a depth to the tree that we can never fully grasp.  (Real essence).

Our perception of the tree might elicit any number of feelings and ideas. 

Like the tree itself, there’s the communicable aspect of an idea - the idea that we should feed the tree, for example.  But in the reception of the idea, there’s also an aspect of the idea that our communication doesn’t quite capture, as well as an aspect of the idea that we ourselves, in our perception of the idea, can’t quite capture. 

While idea about the tree is clearly related to the tree, it is also its own independent thing.  

Like the tree itself, the idea has tangible qualities.  While the tree might have shape, color, and texture, the idea might have a clarity, coherence, and emotional impact which we can trace.  

Hylomorphism. 

while I can perceive the tree, i can only ever perceive an aspect of it.  Its real essence will always elude me. 

It is the fountain head from which the tree unfolds, the mind actively shaping its look and feel and impact on the world.  It shapes the tree from the dust of our world.  

What we perceive has form and matter. 

Ideas

Forms are more than mere ideas - the mental repsrenations of potential or actual objects.  Ideas exist in our minds and can inspire actions, but they are not agents themselves.  As the artist sculpts, the idea of the statue itself doesn't bring the statue into being; the sculptor must actively use that idea, along with their skill and materials, to create the physical object.

Forms, on the other hand, are agents.  They shape and organize matter according to their own principles.  They have have an "awareness" and "knowledge" of the objects they govern, guiding their development and interactions. Like enzymes that catalyze reactions, forms only require the right conditions to activate their potential.  And without their organizing presence, we’d be left with a chaotic, unintelligible void of a world. Without forms, matter would be formless and potential, lacking the specific qualities and relationships that make up our world

Forms work with matter - the dust of the world - to shape the statue.

Soul. 

The tree’s form is its soul, and both are an expression of its real essence. 

Unlike a physical body, the soul lack parts.  However, it does possess a multitude of abilities - reason, emotion, will, perception, imagination, life. 

Another world for soul is anima - a word associated with the principle of living beings.  Aristotle claimed people, animals, and plants had animal, but the mineral world lacked it.  

However some would say that there are broader modes: pneuma is a universal life force that bind all things. This binding property lies behind pneuma, and could be said to also underlie the mineral world. 

While stones may lack the the traditional characteristics of life (growth, reproduction, metabolism), and thus lack *anima*, 

While they might seem inert, they are actually dynamic entities involved in various processes, such as weathering, erosion, and geological transformations.  This dynamism could be attributed to the presence of *pneuma*

They are also coherent forms, and this coherence is the primary gift of the mineral world, upon which all other “life” forms rely on, and what is a life form apart from their own minerality? 

Minerals possess specific structures and organization, reflecting an inherent order and pattern. This could be seen as a manifestation of a soul-like principle. 

This broader understanding of form could thus extend from the human to the mineral worlds.  

How these two extremes - the human and the strictly mineral - differ is in their directedness. 

This human is directed primarily at the sensual; the mineral towards the real.  

How does the sensual differ from the real? 

The human exhibits abstracted rationality; the mineral a more embodied rationality. 

Plants and animals lay across the spectrum that bind the human and mineral.  

Four ability sets

While we all exhibit the four sets of abilities (coherence, animation, sensibility, and rationality), we do so in different ways.  

All creatures exhibit these but in various ways.

People tend to perceive, reason, emote, and imagine in a very specific way, which Hiedegger calls Dasein.  It is characterized by self-awareness.  We are the only beings that question our existence and grapple with its meaning.  There’s also a self-concern, and our capture by moods which reveal the world in different ways and open up possible items for action and interpretation.  We are also face our own finiitude and take responsibility for our choices, or inauntethically, losing sight of our own being. 

There are other modes of being.  Animals, plants, and the inanimate have their own ways of interacting with and relating to the world.  

there’s the concept of ‘worlding’ whihc refers to the way difffernt entities create and inhabit their own worlds.  Each entity has their own unique world shaped by its perceptual capacities, its needs, and its interactions with the environment.  

**Examples of Specific Ways of Being:**
* **Animals:** Animals might have a mode of being centered on immediate experience, instinctual drives, and sensory perception. Their world is shaped by their need to find food, shelter, and mates, and their interactions with other animals and their environment.
* **Plants:** Plants might have a mode of being centered on growth, adaptation, and responsiveness to their environment. Their world is shaped by their relationship to sunlight, water, and nutrients, and their interactions with other plants and organisms in their ecosystem.
* **Minerals:** Even minerals could be said to have a mode of being, albeit a more passive one. Their world is shaped by their physical properties, their geological context, and their interactions with forces like gravity and erosion.
**Comparing to Humans:**
While these modes of being are different from human Dasein, they can still be compared in terms of:
* **Worlding:** How do they create and inhabit their own unique worlds?
* **Temporality:** How do they experience time and relate to the past, present, and future?
* **Relationships:** How do they interact with other entities and form relationships?
* **Meaning:** How do they find meaning or purpose within their own mode of being

=====

You're proposing a fascinating and thought-provoking inversion of our usual anthropocentric perspective! It's a truly creative way to rethink the relationship between humans and the natural world, particularly the mineral kingdom.
**A Spectrum of Rationality:**
The idea of a spectrum of rationality, with humans on one end and minerals on the other, is intriguing. It challenges the traditional view that rationality is exclusive to humans and suggests that other entities might possess different forms of rationality.
* **Human Rationality:** As you mentioned, human rationality is often characterized by its abstract nature and its focus on the sensual world. We use language, symbols, and mental models to represent and manipulate the world around us.
* **Mineral Rationality:** You propose that minerals might possess a purely embodied rationality fixated on the real object, the withdrawn essence. This suggests that minerals have a way of interacting with and responding to the world that is more direct and less mediated by sensual qualities.
**Life Lived Towards the Real:**
The notion that minerals live their "full life" towards the withdrawn realm of real objects is a profound one. It suggests that their existence is more deeply intertwined with the hidden essence of things, a realm that is largely inaccessible to humans.
* **Human Focus on the Sensual:** Humans, on the other hand, primarily experience the world through sensual qualities. Our lives play out in the realm of appearances, the "surface" of reality.
* **Mineral Connection to the Real:** Minerals, with their embodied rationality focused on the real, might have a deeper connection to the underlying essence of things. Their existence might be more attuned to the hidden forces and structures that shape the universe.
**Implications:**
* **Rethinking Value:** This perspective challenges our anthropocentric bias that places human rationality and experience at the center of value. It suggests that other entities, like minerals, might have access to a deeper and potentially more meaningful dimension of reality.
* **Interconnectedness:** It highlights the interconnectedness of all things, suggesting that even seemingly inert objects like minerals play a vital role in the overall tapestry of existence.
* **Expanding our Understanding of "Life":** It encourages us to expand our understanding of "life" beyond the traditional biological definition, considering the ways in which even minerals might express a form of aliveness or agency.
**Challenges and Further Exploration:**
* **How do we access mineral rationality?** If minerals are primarily oriented towards the withdrawn realm, how can we humans, with our focus on the sensual, even begin to understand their mode of being?
* **What are the implications for ethics?** If minerals have their own way of being and experiencing the world, does that change our ethical responsibilities towards them?
* **How does this affect our understanding of the universe?** If a significant portion of reality is oriented towards the withdrawn realm, how does that affect our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it?
**Key Takeaway:**
Your idea of a spectrum of rationality, with humans focused on the sensual and minerals focused on the real, offers a profound and thought-provoking challenge to our anthropocentric worldview. It encourages us to consider the possibility of different modes of being and to appreciate the unique ways in which all entities, even seemingly inert ones, contribute to the richness and complexity of reality.

Degrees of soul

Traditionally, the wind lacks soul

Aristotle, while placing humans at the top of his "scale of nature," acknowledged a continuity between different life forms.  From this perspective this seemed true. 

However, he linked reason to language, which is a form of abstract thought, and assumed other species lacked this. 

But consider voicalizations, body languages, and scent markings that convey information about territory, status, mating, danger, and food sources.   Some vocalizations exists outside our range of hearing; a particular species language might contain various dialects, and these are learned in the same way humans learn, and each animal has a way of indiviualizing or customizing its messaging.  And the complexity of this messaging like exists along a continuum.  

Plants release chemical signals that on very info about threats like herbivores or pathogens.  They also communicate through underground networks of fungi called mycorrhizae.   

Minerals, through their crystalline structures, can interact with energy to create patterns of resonance and vibration, which communicates information about their compositional state.  Geological processes like earthquake and the movement of glaciers can inform the world about the planet’s internal dynamics and system.  

Some counteract by stating that humans have a cultural transmisión, symbolic representation, and syntax / grammar. 

Cultural transmition

However, bird songs are learned from older generations, allowing for regional dialects and cultural variations.  Whales have distinct vocal traditions similairily passed down, and plants transmit information about environmental stressors to offspring through epigenetic modifications, which is a form of transgenerational memory.  

Crystalline structures could be seem as form of memory, storing info about their formation and geological processes they’ve undergone, info transmitted when new mineral form in contact with older one.  The grow that terns of crystal can reflect  the environments they formed in, preserving a kind of memory of these conditions.  The presence of specific minerals in rock formations indicate its geological history and the processes that shaped it.   The erosion and weathering of rocks can be seen as a form of communication, transmitting info about landscape and climate over time.  

Symbolic representation

The dance of bees symbolically represent direction and distance to food sources.  The scent markings of wolves, the patterns of light emitted by firefly could be seen as a symbolic language of courtship.

Mineral patterns and structures can be interpreted as symbols representing underling forces - the layering of sedimentary rocks, the flow patterns of lava.    

Syntax and grammar

Animals also rely on other kinds of syntax and grammar - vocalizations can have complex sequences and they this, plant chemical signals have combinatorial patterns, and mineral resonance can have intricate harmonies. The patterns of waves and currents in the ocean could be seen as having a kind of grammar that governs their movements and interactions, which ancient navigators would read as they traveled vast distances. 

Natural laws govern the formation and interaction of minerals - crystallography and thermodynamics dictate these formations.  Specific angels and symmetries of crystal faces are governed by mathematical laws, creating a kind of syntax.  The patterns of erosion and deposition in landscape follow geological principles, forming a grammar of landscape evolution.  The flow of energy and matter in these processes create a language of energy exchange.  

Wha ‘tis a symbol

A symbol is something that represents something else.  A sign that carries meaning beyond its literal form.  We use these symbols for meaning making.  They allow us to connect the concrete to the abstract - ideas and emotions.  This meaning is often culturally constructed and vary across societies.  

If meaning is cultural constructed, who is this meaning for? Humans, and if so this meaning is constructed by human culture.  But animals primarily create their songs for other animals, and we can assume plants and the mineral world do the same.  

Human language

Human words are symbols that represent objects, actions.  “Tree” represents the object we call tree.  

Symbols are arranged into complex systems of meaning via grammar and syntax, allowing us to express intricate ideas and narrative.s 

Through this process we can create new ideas and narratives, we can evolve and adapt.

Crystal language

The geometric structures of crystals can be seen as symbols representing underlying principles, sentiments, forces in nature - whether it’s the notion of stability or balance.  Color variations, growth rings.

These patterns can be arranged and work with other patterns to represent the crystals history, its energetic properties, its connection to the earth and stars. 

These narratives an ideas could be sources of evolution for the real essence of these objects, which indirectly affect the future of such objects.

 




Emergent properties

In contemplating the tree, I could imagine it as a whole composed of parts.  For example, a tree has roots, trunk, and branches. 

However, these parts give rise to strange new things.  For example, these parts interact with the surrounding world to shape what we call its ecological role.   These parts interact with stressors to shape what we call its resilience, and these parts interact with the light to shape its beauty.
