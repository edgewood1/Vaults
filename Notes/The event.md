# The event


The accident left me with this: 
- fatigue

Daytime naps lead to vivid dreams

Meditation leads to light body activation

When I touch a tree I feel pulse. 

An emotion can overwhelm, and I see the consequence of my actions upon not just the moment + for myself but for the others many lifetimes. 

This has led me to live in a cottage for years.  Away from folks. 

A series of investigations.

My reports: 

1. Our body consists of multiple centers, but the most evident ones are
2. Brain pulsating electrical currents though a nervous system
3. Heart pumping blood through a circulatory system.
4. Is there a lung system.
5. A doing system? 

Our world, at its center, contains a heart - the sun.  
There are many suns in our universe, but ours is the most relevant for our world. 
It simultaneously absorbs the energies of the world and emits them.  It is a site of recycling. 

This exists in smaller ways throughout.  Cells, organisms, and systems function in this way. 

Sunlight is fills our space, an emission.  Less keenly felt is the space of negative pressure which is ever absorbing light.  The things of the world take their shape between these two spaces.  

The rays of this light are called elementals. 

They are organized into types, called elementary spirits.

Because of our level of complexity, we are able to interact with angelic forces

Beyond this higher angels direct the movements of our reality, including that of the sun. 

Apart from this all is the true center - seemings invisible.  But it is the principle that enables form and content - the definition for the lines that define the world and the forces that maintain them.


Elementals are grains of sand in a bucket
Yet they have the ability to gather among a multitude and work as an organism.
Thus as many they operate as one might alone, and always in service of a higher power. 
They are much like a word that serves the will of a cultivated speaker. 

My first experience of elementals were the remants born of working with plants all day.

They were light infused.  There were several and they swayed in their patterns and pulsated their light.  What stood out for me was their rhythmic nature.  

Elemental spirits appears as influences. 

Angels as voices - rare.  Or more likely, though their assuaging of tumultuous consciousness or their offerings of thoughts, emotions, impulses to act.
