# Angels


In the physical
There are things we can see
Some are can’t see
Others can
These can perceive and are perceived
But we can only ever perceive an aspect of them at one time

This is also the case in the spirit

Transcendental objects - objects 
Angels -subjects

Angels are given ideas at birth
These are immediate awareness in the mind of god
Original inheritance of ideas
Participation in divine ideas in god
A particular set that is domain
They don’t need to reason to arrive at it.  
They have instant knowledge of all I. Their domain
We’re able also to grasp first principles inuitivelh
A thing can’t can and can’t be at once
Being fed and now t being. Aren’t the same
This is like angelic knowledge.  
they have agency so they can suggest to the imagination.  They can encourage healing.  They don’t know the future but are good predictors.
