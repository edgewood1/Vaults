Two kinds of intuitions - immediate intuition and divination. 

1 - Immediate knowledge or perception is close to 'vision 
It is a type of knowledge in which a thing is known direct- ly and not through an intermediary. 
There are three basic subdivisions here: 
A) Sense perception is immediate knowledge of a concrete object - not its essence, but its accidents. All subsequent knowledge is contin- gent upon it; 
B) Intuition of the self occurs not through tńe self's es- sence, but through the self's operations, a kind of reflecting back upon
itself which results in immediate knowledge of itself; 
C) Intellectual perception is an intuition in the broadest sense because while it allows for a subjective intermediary, a concept, there is no objective interme- diary that stands between the mind and the thing. 
 Intellectual perception is different from ananoetic knowledge or indirect knowledge be- cause the latter lacks this immediate, direct contact with a particular object. This kind of knowledge, knowledge by analogy, is by definition not intuitive, since its formal object cannot be known directly; whereas intuition, including the types discussed above, have no objective inter-


1. Divination or inclination is not knowledge of immediacy, but rather of spontaneity, an intuition of the heart, a kind of spurtingl forth of the right idea without any prior discursive reason- ing. This second type of intuition - referred to earlier as connaturality - while not philosophical or scholarly, is essentially common to all people in their everyday experiences. In BPT, Maritain does not subdi- vide this type of knowledge, but in Range of Reason (RR), he lays out and explains the basic types of connaturality: mystical, poetic, and moral. These three types of connaturality will be treated in separate sections later on in this paper. -
