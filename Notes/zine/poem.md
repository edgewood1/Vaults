poem

Baldwin states.  There was the whiteness of Europe.  In America, it was forced to confront its own darkness and make peace with it.  From this, arose the American identity.
Levenda states.  The dark and bloody ground.
Steiner states.  The continent is charged by the currents that run along the western and eastern mountain ridges.
Three frontiers: the stars, the land, our inner life.
