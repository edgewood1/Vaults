# Plants


Sentient creatures perceive images
Images contain emotional content
Emotional content imply intent - positive or negative
Examples:
a plant perceives in light a positive intent
A plant perceives in dark a contrasting intent

Neutral intent

Some objects, such as the wind, might be coded as implying neutral intent, but they can later be coded as positive or negative by virtue of association. 
Studies have shown that pairing wind with light can “train” plants to associate the two, and thus strive for windy places because such places might contain light. 
For the sake of adaptation, it could be that previously negative or positive intents could be coded as neutral or contrasting

Modes of association

Aristotle has his 4 laws of association
- similarity: real or metaphorical
- Contrast
- Continguity in space / time (2 different ones)

To this others have been added (see emailed paper)
- relation(milk-butter)
- Induction / deduction
- Cause - effect
- Figures of speech rhythm / rhyme
- Assonance
- Etymological roots

Human thought system

Images 
Concepts - abstracted images; an object that points to all objects associated by a definition
Symbol - an object that points to other objects
Images invoke images and other concepts based on laws of associationl. Concepts do the same.

Plants, animals, human

Plants can be “trained” through pruning and binding branches.  they are also trained by the conditions of their birth: their seeds may sprout in unusual settings and yet they must thrive.  Training, for plants, is a analogous to “adaptation”

Animals have a larger range of sensory input.  Like plants, they are shaped by their terrain.  However, society can impose restrictions on animals, and these restrictions constitute a kind of binding.  Also many animals can visually perceive in enough detail to differentiate among a series of human gestures, so that a dog might learn to associate that if it sits upon seeing a hand gesture, it will relieve a treat (good intention).   Eventually, the treat can be removed because the sitting upon a gesture itself is associated with goodness.

Humans can also be trained.  For them, training means learning to perform a particular skill or behavior.  

in addition, there’s education - the systematic process of learning.  Acquiring knowledge, learning facts, theories, concepts, beliefs, principles.  This has to do with the realm of abstraction / concepts

Here, we learn to work with concepts and facts

Hierarchy of knowledge / concepts

1. An event, person, place, thing (an image)
2. A claim about this thing
	1. Is + adjective (shaped by intent)
	2. Is + object (classification)
	3. Action + object + phrases (actions attributable to thing might be shaped by intent)
3. Opinion - a claim lacks evidence
4. Fact - a claim that has verifiable evidence
5. These are statements
6. They are shaped with language
7. Concept is an abstracted object
8. Do claims have abstractions? Yes - “that plant is beautiful” is a called a “value judgment” or declarative sentence (depending on the field of study).
9. Concepts + images can be used in reasoning - we can apply the laws of logic to yield new insights / knowledge
10. Knowledge is a claim about a think that is verifiable and that we believe in
11. Belief - coherence of thoughts about the world
12. True - correspondence of thought to world, verifiable by others
13. Justification - the specific reason for a claim
14. Knowledge - true justifiable belief
15. Concepts are bound by theories
16. Theories are bound by principles / laws


Kinds
1. Slithering - easily seen
2. Red hair of poison ivy - not so easily seen
3. Shape of a plant associated with a part of the body
4. No visual difference

2 + 3 requires more common sense than 1
1 - we easily associate with a positive / negative value
A stronger form of common sense goes beyond simple values (x is good or x is good for the kidneys) and extracts a function / virtue: x removes excess water from kidneys
4 requires the most common sense

What is it about slithering that instills fear?
- snakes as ancient enemies - they sneak in and bite and kill
- Could the fear go deeper - dna, the underlying reality that enable snakes?

Red = apple, poison ivy, fire, tounge/inside/ strawberries, power

Plant-human connection

Once humans were human-plant hybrids. 
To evolve , the hybrids cast off aspects of their organs
The cast off organs became species of plants
The remaining hybrid organism became humans
However, the plant-species continued to resonate with their human organs with which they were once bonded

Human - animal perception

Two criteria: quality and object of perception

Quality
Animals have sharper perception while humans must use extended concentration to sharpen perception
Also, humans can invent observational tools

Object of perception
Animals can only apply their perception to outer objects while humans can apply it to inner objects: images, concepts, emotion


Phases of the will - according to Steiner
- instinct 
- Urge (etheric) ~ is this the same as impulse? Strong / near uncontrollable
- Desire (astral) - related to absence
- Wish, ideal, motive (ego)

Sign - an object that points to another object: denotation
Referent - the object pointed to
Signs are entangled in a web of association 
Symbols - a sign that connotes
Meaning - describes a relation between two things

3 kinds of meaning
Non-verbal symbols - things (social)
Smoke > fire - natural
Things may/not have immediate meaning

If a dog is trained to respond to a hand gesture, this gesture becomes a term in its vocabulary.  however, animals can only read, not express, such vocabulary.  

Animals have a sixth sense underdeveloped in humans.



Image making process - non-discursive
