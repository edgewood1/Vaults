we require a system of difference to find meaning, and so we require “woman, to understand the concept “man”, 
and it has become socially convenient to privilege the concept “man” over “woman” even though one could say
that each contains aspects of the other within.   But we can go beyond this subordinating practice to the system of inscription 
that enables us to subordinate in teh first place. 

this system of difference goes beyond writing and speech in the sense that it may be used in all forms of inscription - whether its carving notches into a post or arranging a household.
