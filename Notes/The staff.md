# The staff

Certainly appear friendly and enthusiastic but after observing during my one hour stay it seemed superficial.  In their enthusiasm they sold to my wife and  I a one month plan which after cancelling due to non-use they when one to explain they went on to explain by one month they actually meant three onsets of one month plans.  Apparently if we sales rep didn’t cogent this clearly enough we could defer to the fine print of our contract.  If they are this disingenuous with a simple sales transaction, I’m confident that the products they’re prescribing and their health reps are equally suspect.
