Prana - mostly polyester
Roku - polyester
Patagonia - cotton / polyester

Yes, for the best protection against shrinkage and to maintain the fabric's integrity, washing in **cold water** and **hanging to dry** (or laying flat) is the recommended standard for cotton/Tencel blends

High heat is used for sanitation - towels - preshrunk products.
