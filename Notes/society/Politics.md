# Politics


I’m not sure that the Fisher line is appropriate there.  People aren’t often aware of the zeitgeist until the election results are in.  People seem to think candidate X is definitely going to win, but then the votes show the opposite.  So either the election is rigged, or there was a public sentiment that really contradicted what politicians, pollsters, and the media minority had in mind.  While it seems that canvassing is not effective, it’s not of the atmosphere that makes it seem like resistance is pointless - many of these people who are resisting feel like they are winning, until they realize they have not won.   Anyhow, it seems then that the distinction is between the canvasser who feels they are winning, and trying to win over people one by one, and the just the general mass that is going to choose regardless of the canvassers effort.  And then there’s this third option of magic-art-prayer.  

I wonder also if the canvasser’s efforts can be seen as a type of magic-art-prayer, and it really comes down to the kind of energy the canvasser is putting out tinto the cultural atmosphere.  If this canvasser feels they need to “convert” people, then they actually are sabotaging their movement, but if they approach it as a performance or entertainment where they are making genuine connection regardless of the others approach, then they might change things.  This might be seen as a kind of gratitude prayer for the other.  and in this sense, i wonder if praying for the opposition is about as effective as going out and trying to convert them.  Can we modify this toward this end: 

I’ve been thinking about whether traditional political work (canvassing, voting) is actually effective, or if we are just at the mercy of a massive, unstoppable 'Zeitgeist'—a historic current that decides elections long before we cast a ballot.   This is the result of tiny relational interactions of the last few years.  

Mark Fisher describes this entrapment of Zeitgeist  as Capitalist Realism: a psychological atmosphere so thick that we can’t even imagine a future outside of the current system, making standard political resistance feel like struggling in quicksand.

However, there is a third option beyond 'winning the debate' or 'riding the zeitgist.' Gilles Deleuze argues for a 'micropolitics'—the idea that mass reality is built from the bottom up by tiny, invisible flows of desire and affect.  The idea of injecting new “lines of flight” into the system.  

If you change the 'molecular' level (how people feel, relate, and dream), the 'molar' level (politics) eventually shifts in a corresponding way.  

This aligns with the work of occultist Kenneth Grant, who suggests that true change comes from the 'Nightside' or the 'Mauve Zone'—the subconscious realm of imagination and magic. 

In this view, spiritual work or prayer isn't a retreat from the world; it changes the invisible frequency of the culture (the Zeitgeist) so that a new political reality becomes possible.

Version 2 ========

Coincidentally, when you sent me that last email on prayer, I had been journaling about prayer and politics.  I meant to share this yesterday, but forgot: 

So there’s this question of whether traditional political work (canvassing, voting) is actually effective, or if we are just at the mercy of a massive, invisible 'Zeitgeist'—an often-hidden historic current that decides elections long before we cast a ballot; misled by our own bubbles, our side might feel like it’s winning until the 'mass' reveals a reality that contradicts all our polls and conversations.

These two experiences are those of opposing sides and the tide to which we are all subject.  Both contrasting and complementing these experiences, Deleuze has this concept of 'micropolitics'—the idea that reality is built from the bottom up by tiny, invisible flows of desire and affect.   

Through this concept, canvassers (as an example) who either preach to the choir or confront oppositional voices of which they are fearful or misunderstand, these  folks partake in a form of self-sabotage since they further entrench both sides and sometimes even fuel the other side against them.  If a canvasser goes out trying to 'correct' people, they are just reinforcing the conflict. 

But such political work might be redeemed if it shifts its tactics from conversion to connection.  If they approach it as a form of art or gratitude—making a genuine energetic connection regardless of politics—they are injecting a new 'line of flight' into the system.

Art, Gratitude, and Prayer is that they are all acts of Radical Non-Transactionality.

In a Zeitgeist defined by Capitalist Realism (where everything is a deal, a trade, or a competition) and Right-Wing Hyperstition (where everything is a threat or a war), … or even traditional forms of politicking (like canvassing to convert), the most rebellious thing you can do is an action that has no utility, no price tag, and no enemy.

These acts break the logic of scarcity.  

The “system” assumes we only give if we get - that energy is finite.  But art creates beauty for its own sake, not for efficiency.  Gratitude gives credit without losing status one’s self.  Prayer surrenders time and attention to the Invisible without a guaranteed receipt.  All three are forms of Gift.  They generate a surplus of energy (love, beauty, hope) that the economic system cannot capture or tax.  This “useless” energy leaks out of the system, creating a “line of flight” simply because the system doesn’t know how to process something that isn’t a commodity. 

The system relies on our keeping our guard up: to defend ourselves as a voter, consumer, victim.  Art requires you to dissolve your rigid view of the world to see something new.  Gratitude requires you to lower your shield and admit you recieved help.  Prayer requires you to admit you are small and the Universe is big.  All 3 acts are ones of vulnerability.  You cannot pray, thank, or create while holding a weapon or a grudge.  Therefore, performing them forces you to drop the armor of the current political wave.  You stop being a node in the culture war and become a “flow” in the rhizome. 

Deleuze distinguishes between Chronos (linear, measuring time, work time) and Aion (deep time, the moment, the eternal).  The system traps us in Chronos through deadlines, election cycles, news cycles.  However, art suspends time, gratitude stops the rush to appreciate the now, prayer connects the instant to the eternal.  All three are interrupters.  They slash the “progress narrative”.  They force us to step out fo the race and into presence.  
The coherent thread is Gratuitousness (which shares a root with Gratitude).
To be "gratuitous" means to be uncalled for, unwarranted, and free.
• Art is gratuitous creation. ￼
• Gratitude is gratuitous appreciation. ￼
• Prayer is gratuitous connection.

So, praying for the opposition or engaging in 'gratitude' work isn't passive;  it changes the invisible frequency of the culture (the molecular level) so that the political outcome (the molar level) can finally shift.

Historical examples of such work can be found among the surrealists, who sought to unlock the unconscious and disrupt the internal disciplines that obey state control.  For example, Dali used techniques to deliberately misinterpreted reality and impose their own delusions upon it.  This reminds me of how the right reject the facts to impose a sheer will to power.  

You’re mentioned the urban wandering of the situationist internal, and how cities were designed to force us into molar routines, and if we would drop the rational motives and drift thought he city, guided only by attraction and feeling, we could create a line of flight.  By walking the wrong way, we break the invisible grid of capitalist control, creating a new map of the city.  (It’d be cool to make a map of Durham that highlighted not Duke, Tobaco campus, and Southpoint mall, and instead the invisible emotional landmarks of the community?) 

Dada’s anti-art had the example (as did Burroughs) of cut-ups on newspapers that broke the spell of media propaganda, scrambling the code, and thus hampering the transmission of its signal.  

also the way the counterculture would refuse to desire the things the state offered (a house, career, suit), and opt for a vacuum, thus questioning what a “good life” at the moldeculr level.  

finally, the Russian cosmism believed the ultimate political oppression was death itself. Ignoring elections entirely, they argued that the only true politics is the scientific-spiritual conquest of death and the colonization of space, shifting the focus from temporary policy to the cosmic constraints of existence.  This approach reminds me of the “tech-bros”.  

Some of these approaches of breaking state control have already been adopted by the right.  Checking" (Concept A) fails because it brings a knife to a spell-fight. However, fighting it with pure chaos (Concept C) just adds to the noise.

The Hermetic Solution: Distinction vs. Connection
The difference lies in the direction of the irrationality.

The “fascist” right and leftuses the irrational to Contract and Separate. It creates a "Paranoid" line. It simplifies the world into "Us vs. Them." It is Arborescent madness (one rigid trunk of Truth).

Deleuzian/Hermetic Hyperstition uses the irrational to Expand and Connect, to break boundaries. It complicates the world, revealing hidden connections between the self and the other ("As above, so below").

The Antidote is to not fight their "War is Good" spell with "No, War is Bad" (Rationality).  Instead, you fight it by generating a Hermetic counter-reality that is so interconnected, beautiful, and complex that their simple, paranoid story collapses under the weight of the new connections. You don't "debunk" their myth; you out-dream it with a myth that includes them in a way they can't resist. 

These movements suggest that to combat a toxic Zeitgeist (even one fueled by right-wing hyperstition), we must not retreat to dry rationalism. Instead, we must employ a Hermetic Balance: engaging the irrational power of art and magic to weave a reality that is more connected, more potent, and more alive than the paranoid fictions of the opposition
