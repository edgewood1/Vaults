# politics: southern strategy


dealignment of whites from the democratic
and realignment with the repulbican

republicans are associated with the northern industry / business, abe lincoln, strong federal government - 

democrats is the party of the south, of slavery, andrew jackson, jim crow
but also populism, anti-elitism, fear of big banks, big governemnts - so about states rights

then during reconstruction, free blacks voting republicans, but republicans ignore then - more interested on southern racists.  

then, white democrats control south
1954 brown v. board of ed
texas 1956 - race congressional - bruce allenger won as a moderate republican into gradualism - but then ran as a segregationist b/c he saw a change in the community - criswell baptist saw that bible supported segregationalist and john tower senator - it worked for them

LBJ, democrat, crushes barrywater, who not a racist but an ideologist - into states right, constitution strict, no government programs, not into civil rights. barry goldwater gets crushed everywhere except the deep south - so first time a republican who wasn’t racist won the deep south.
