# Fairness


While Durham City residents could face misdemeanor charges for repeated noise offenses, Duke students are subject to a different system, primarily through the Duke Community Standard (DCS). Duke students can face disciplinary actions outlined in the DCS for violating local noise ordinances, but these actions don't involve criminal charges. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

City Residents:
* **Durham's noise ordinance:** Applies 24/7, with stricter regulations after 11 pm, <u>[according to Duke Student Affairs](https://students.duke.edu/living/housing/graduate-professional-housing/housing-in-durham/durham-ordinances-and-policies/)</u>.
* **Criminal consequences:** Violations can result in citations and court appearances, <u>[as noted by Duke Student Affairs](https://students.duke.edu/living/housing/graduate-professional-housing/housing-in-durham/durham-ordinances-and-policies/)</u>.
* **Misdemeanor charges:** For repeated offenses, city residents could face misdemeanor charges. 
Duke Students:

* **Disciplinary actions:**Duke students can face sanctions such as warnings, suspension, or even expulsion for violating noise ordinances, according to Duke University.
* **No criminal charges:**While Duke students may face disciplinary action, they are not typically subject to criminal charges for noise violations. 
Key Difference:
The primary difference is that Duke students are subject to the university's disciplinary system for violating local ordinances, while city residents face potential criminal charges

Whether it's "standard" or "fair" for Duke students to potentially face different consequences for noise violations than other Durham residents is a complex issue with varying perspectives. Here's a breakdown of the situation:
## **1. Duke Students and Durham's Noise Ordinance:**
* 		Off-campus Duke students are generally subject to the City of Durham's noise ordinance, just like any other Durham resident. 
* 		Durham's ordinance applies 24/7, with stricter limits after 11 p.m.. 
* 		Violations can result in citations and legal consequences. 
## **2. Duke University's Internal Policies:**
* Duke University also has its own set of policies regarding student conduct and noise, which apply both on and off campus.
* These policies emphasize respect for others and adherence to local ordinances.
* Students can be held accountable for violations of both University policy and Durham city ordinances.
* Duke has a "Good Neighbor Program" aimed at promoting positive community relations between students and Durham residents, including education on noise expectations. 
## **3. Potential Differences in Enforcement and Consequences:**
* 		Enforcement: Durham Police handle enforcement of city ordinances, while Duke's Office of Student Conduct handles violations of the Duke Community Standard. 
* 		Consequences: Durham may impose fines or court appearances for ordinance violations. Duke could also impose internal sanctions such as disciplinary action within the university. 
## **4. Perspectives on Fairness:**
* 		Some residents feel strongly that all residents should be treated equally under the law, regardless of student status. 
* 		Some argue that Duke students might have a different understanding of community expectations or be less aware of local ordinances compared to long-term residents. 
* 		Duke emphasizes its efforts to educate students about their responsibilities as community members, including following local noise ordinances. 
In summary: While Duke students are subject to the same noise ordinances as other Durham residents, enforcement and consequences may involve both city and university systems. Perceptions of fairness can vary depending on individual viewpoints and experiences.
