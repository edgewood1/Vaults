# project grading


unctionality - 
- check requirements and see that app does what its required to do 
- test various kinds of unconventional inputs (does app break easily?)
- test buttons, links, etc
- check console for potential errors
- check for responsive / sensible layout
- check for potential optimization suggestions
- check api / server / database responses
briefly look at the code - 
- folders/files structured right? 
- code organized? 
- code of student-level quality? 
- are functions of sensible length? balanced comments? appropriate variable naming? clear logic? 
Read grading rubric for each homework. The vary, but typically: 
A - perfection; offer encouragment and/or a minor observation for improvement
B/C - make 2+ balanced suggestions and encouragement
D/F - no way to test full functionality due to errors - let them know via slack
