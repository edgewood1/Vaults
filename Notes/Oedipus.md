What she sees between us is what she assumes is at the basis all her life. 

Sex, touch, kindness, sharing, conversation, connection as any form as bargaining chips (conditional vs unconditional love).

The fact that she experiences some of these things at specific intervals (bedtime) & that at any moment they might be threatened by violence of speech or physicality.

The fact that one can become so obsessed about trivialities that it prevents us from seeing the larger picture, the creative context, and causes us to self-isolate even when surrounded by others.
