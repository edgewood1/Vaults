The real expresses itself through form. If form is what shapes a thing, then soul is the form of an animated thing.

One issue with this distinction is that while the inanimate might seem inert, they are actually dynamic entities involved in various processes, such as weathering, erosion, and geological transformations.

Thus, another distinction might revolve around agency.

“Living” things have agency whereas the non-living are passive - if they undergo various processes, the source of the movement is not themselves but another. (Isn’t this what Aquinas ultimately argues - all things move as a result of another thing outside itself).

while an inanimate object might not propel itself through space, it is internally motivated to maintain its shape through dynamic processes. Consider the power by which a crystal or rock maintains itself, and how difficult it is to break it.

Another world for soul is anima - a word associated with the principle of living beings. While stones may lack the the traditional characteristics of life (growth, reproduction, metabolism), and thus lack anima,

If this word is extended to the living, we might use the word Pneuma, the life force that binds all things, to describe both the animate and nonanimmate. pneuma is a universal life force that bind all things. This binding property lies behind pneuma, and could be said to also underlie the mineral world. The dynamism behind cohesiveness could be attributed to the presence of pneuma

Minerals possess specific structures and organization, reflecting an inherent order and pattern. Coherence is the primary gift of the mineral world, upon which all other “life” forms rely on, and what is a life form apart from their own minerality?

**Directedness // stop**

How these two extremes - the human and the strictly mineral - differ is in their directedness.

This human is directed primarily at the sensual; the mineral towards the real.

How does the sensual differ from the real?

The human exhibits abstracted rationality; the mineral a more embodied rationality.

Plants and animals lay across the spectrum that bind the human and mineral.

**Four ability sets**

Soul possess a multitude of abilities - reason, emotion, will, perception, imagination, life.

While we all exhibit the four sets of abilities (coherence, animation, sensibility, and rationality), we do so in different ways.

All creatures exhibit these but in various ways.

People tend to perceive, reason, emote, and imagine in a very specific way, which Hiedegger calls Dasein. It is characterized by:
* self-awareness. We are the only beings that question our existence and grapple with its meaning.
* self-concern, and our capture by moods which reveal the world in different ways and open up possible items for action and interpretation.
* We are also face our own finiitude and take responsibility for our choices, or inauntethically, losing sight of our own being.
Animals, plants, and the inanimate have their own modes of being: ways of interacting with and relating to the world; ways of creating and inhabiting their own worlds. shaped by its perceptual capacities, its needs, and its interactions with the environment.

While these modes of being are different from human Dasein, they can still be compared in terms of:
* How they create and inhabit their own unique worlds.
* How they experience time and relate to the past, present, and future?
* How they interact with other entities and form relationships?
* How they find meaning or purpose within their own mode of being
Examples of Specific Ways of Being:

Animals might have a mode of being centered on:
* immediate experience, instinctual drives, and sensory perception.
* Finding food, shelter, and mates, and their interactions with other animals and their environment.
Plants might have a mode of being centered on
* growth, adaptation, and responsiveness to their environment.
* Finding sunlight, water, and nutrients, and their interactions with other plants and organisms in their ecosystem.
Even minerals could be said to have a mode of being, albeit a more passive one. Their world is shaped by
* their physical properties, their geological context, and their interactions with forces like gravity and erosion.
