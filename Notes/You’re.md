# You’re

An original so glad that I have met you
You’ve changed the waking hour of
My nights
I hear you’re living well now with the literati
Hope you found it easy queen l


Your sad he showed me the old war chest
Relics from when they’d abandon men to lot fates
Alone in a winter to buy the rest some time
Hope you found it easier queen l

How do the last 5 years feel like such a short time
Walking the Atlantic shores now  you’re packing out the house
Now they tell me you’ve Married the doctor
Hope you’ve found it easier queen l
