Subject: Application for Software Engineer - Mel DeJesus

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at Avalara. 

As a Durham local living less than a mile from your S Mangum Street office, I have long admired Avalara’s presence in our tech community. A former colleague of mine from UNC Coding Bootcamp, who previously worked at Avalara, spoke highly of the engineering culture, which piqued my interest in joining the team.

I’ve worked in full-stack development for 6+ years.  During this time, I’ve consistently built and improved upon web applications, primarily using React, TypeScript.  I have a history of adapting to new environments, picking up niche platforms and frameworks, as well as new langauges such as Web Components, SDL Tridion CMS, Angular, Perl, Recurly, AWS, and in-house frameworks.

I also appreciate Avalara’s "AI-first" mission.  

I actively experiment with how LLMs can enhance the development process and the functionality of an app.   

Additionally, while the role is remote, I like the prospect of working in a hybrid capacity, in order to collaborate with the team in person.

I look forward to discussing how my background and local commitment to the Durham tech scene can contribute to Avalara’s continued growth. 

Sincerely,
Mel DeJesus
