# Issues


One story was stuck in code review for a week because it was missing an instruction.  It was on a call with mikhail that we figured this out.   This was an added step from che which I found in a dm


My story - 
Write the front end backend
Che refactored backend
Rewrite the front end based on refactor
Debugged the backed
Revised front end due to misunderstanding of goals.  

Improvements?  Split into two parts?  Backend and front end?  List of criteria for both?  

Backend issues.  Return coupon object or calculated discount price?  

Front end.  Top total.  

Out for 1.5 days.  

Bother each other to keep the CR lane clear.  If there are not clear instructions for CR it shouldn’t be on there.  If our test fails for us but not another we should hop on a call.
