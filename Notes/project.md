Nice work, team!

Thsi is a cool app - for me, the highlight is the chart.js visual as well as the nutritional facts featured for each meal.  I also liked the category dropdown. 

<u>A few (rhetorical) questions:</u> 

- your default recipe is teriyaki chicken casserole, but thre’s no nutritional facts for it - if this is the case, should that nutritional box stay hidden? i searched for beef, carrot and it returned the default recipe, so I assume a user can only enter one ingredient at a time? 
- It also seems that searching for a blank name or some bogus input will default to a random selection, is that right?  
- … and that the two searchs are not coordinated, so I can’t search for a ‘side’ that has a ‘beef’ ingredient? 
- i saw the struggle with the cors-request issue.  overall, the code is well-organized.   considering that the js file has gotten quite long, you might consider organizing it around 2 files instead of 1. 

**project grading**

unctionality - 
- check requirements and see that app does what its required to do 
- test various kinds of unconventional inputs (does app break easily?)
- test buttons, links, etc
- check console for potential errors
- check for responsive / sensible layout
- check for potential optimization suggestions
- check api / server / database responses
briefly look at the code - 
- folders/files structured right? 
- code organized? 
- code of student-level quality? 
- are functions of sensible length? balanced comments? appropriate variable naming? clear logic? 
Read grading rubric for each homework. The vary, but typically: 
A - perfection; offer encouragment and/or a minor observation for improvement
B/C - make 2+ balanced suggestions and encouragement
D/F - no way to test full functionality due to errors - let them know via slack
