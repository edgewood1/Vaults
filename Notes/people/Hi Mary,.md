# Hi Mary,


Thanks.  When I reread recently, I saw how I could shorten the whole molar/molecular distinction.  I think connecting that pair to the shift between simple present-aware and past-guided thinking might be a more helpful way to frame things. 

I also agree that meme magic definitely fits into the technomancy umbrella.  I also like the phrase “screen reality”.  

When I think about it, I’m reminded of the idea of the “digital light”, the light that emanates from computer screens as opposed to the “natural” light of the sun or the imagination (if we could even impose this artificial/natural distinction?).  This digital light seems to be the new kid on the block, eager to have its say in the ongoing re-architecting of our nervous systems.

From Steiner’s perspective, the sun provides "Living Light" that nourishes the etheric body and serves as the primary ground of the elementals.  Such light is wisdom informed, helping to rectify our thoughts.  This is further infused by the light of our imagination, allowing us to see a memory or  a poem before it is written, and requires regular exercise. 

In comparison, the Digital light might be the "Dead Light," or what McKenna called the "electronic opiate." Unlike the sun, a screen emits rather than reflects.  Digital light flickers a thousands of times per second in order to render their effects, shifting our brainwaves into suggestible Alpha/Theta states, inducing a light trance that is likely a less critical, and devoid of the elemental soul.   

While the digital and the imaginal could complement one another, in many cases, the first is overtaking the latter, and I wonder if some might eventually forsake the natural light of the world and their freedom, and stop dreaming, simply accepting the machine’s dream.  

Steiner image of world evolution involved humanity splitting into two general portions - those who get swallowed by this digital light, and those who learn to weave together the threads of world knowledge and creation that the digital gives us access to, and orchestrate from these complex streams of production and thought. 

So long as there are clear limits and guidance, there’s value here for education, for synthesizing various media in a way that encourages meta-analysis.  

But out with Fina, I often see parents tethering children as young as two to iPads and headphones as a coping mechanism. This continuous immersion in "Dead Light" is bound to lead to diminished attention spans, a reduced capacity for internal visualization, and delayed emotional mirroring.

I’m not sure if this distinction among kinds of light is helpful or harmful, but it seems clear that meme magic is only the most visible form of technomancy. Do social media threads, curated news apps, and search engines not also participate as broad, algorithmic spell-castings? If we are indeed the objects of these digital enchantments, how do we counter them—short of total exile from the digital world? Perhaps the answer lies in a form of 'artistic alchemy': taking these very Ahrimanic elements and pressing them into the service of non-digital, soulful art, which can then be broadcasted back into the ether as a corrective.
