Being so analytical demanding that she be clear when she’s half asleep.  She just
Needs sympathy.  Then she attacks me.  

I came in and asked her to be kind then she gets in a back and forth.  

This after an afternoon of her running around with her checklist bullshit so homage can get back in time to do who knows what.  

She needs to get back early.  She needs to start letting me know what she does.  And we need to start spend time together after school instead of division of labor.  K can also start picking her up.  

I can also quit my job.  And stop interacting with her family.  

For her.  The needs of others are extensions of her own.   She can’t see those of others.  She is in a dream state and needs to emote and seek soothing but she only see a need for her to articulate which is impossible and then breaks her own rule to breastfeed at night instead of alt methods like my carrying her.  She blind.  If you were to say you need to observe more she wouldn’t know what that means outside of a small definition that suits her needs.
