# Hi Hillary,

Hi Hillary, 

Both are actually smaller and likely lack storage space and the extraroom.  Also, both are located on “through” roads, so experience much more foot / car traffic than Edgewood.

This has stronger interior features but lacks the outdoor features:

Let me know if the tenants have seen any spots in the yard that accumulate excessive water.  

Oscar will likely visit this month to do a final clearing of the gutters / backyard leaves.

And I’ll likely need to show up at some point next month with a worker who will be grading the yard on the west side (where the AC blower is) to encourage water to flow away from the house.  

Let me know if the tenants have seen any other spots in the yard that accumulate excessive water after a heavy rain because this guy could likely work on relieving those spots too.  (I know the greenhouse sometimes floods, as well as the area around the outdoor fireplace).
