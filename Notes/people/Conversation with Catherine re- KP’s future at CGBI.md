# Conversation with Catherine re: KP’s future at CGBI


Framing set-up

* I’m looking for some career advice
* I know you’re planning to retire in the next several years so I’m thinking about the long term viability of my job and visioning what CGBI’s leadership structure might look like if you leave.
	* I could stay at CGBI another 10 years doing the same sort of work
	* I could move on where I might have new experiences and growth in terms of salary
* I do want to stay with CGBI because I know and love the work, and the team is great. Truthfully, salary is what’s motivating me to consider a change.  I could be completely misguided but I do feel that my work here is unique and different than other social/clinical researchers. (How much more am I paid?) ($85,8 compared to $81,5, $83.45, so more, but not by much. Julia makes $100K)
* Is there a scenario we can set-up that could set me up in a different salary pay band? (As you know I’ve maxed out of my current band)
	* I understand there’s the management one that would require having employees to manage
	* Is there something that might fit more along the lines of a leadership position at a center? 
	* Mgr - Robert 
	* University Program Mgr. (non-human resource mgmt)
		* Work w Julia to manage projects (non-content)

I wanted to just talk through how you see CGBI moving into the future and what my role might be. I
