## **I will probably listen to this again, it was such an interesting and clarifying way to approach drawing a timeline of philosophical thought. Things were falling into place for me, and I thought you would like it, too.**

It does sound like a machine is reading, not a person. Not sure about some of the pronunciations!

This matter of the monad, like the general matter of a holistic cosmic sentience, is something I would like to understand because of the practice of prayer being so important to me. A prayer has a beginning and an end, formally speaking. If the believer is rooted in the idea of an imminent divinity of absolute wholeness, whose existence holds the entire ground of the believer's life and sentience, one of the things that happens in prayer is separation. Do you see what I mean? There is a choice to relate to a Divine Other rather than simply be therein. So the formality of beginning a prayer seems like a stepping out of the dance of the cosmos, and 'Amen' a request to rejoin it. What do you think/

Hey thanks!  I can listen to this tonight.  I’m not sure how the podcast uses the word monad - this word has a number of meanings.  At heart, it means “one”.  But that one can be associated with a part of a whole (the individisible immatieral unit of the universe, like a human soul) or the whole from which all things come. 

I like what you’re saying about the ritualistic aspect of prayer, and the tension that it attempts to resolve.  Entering to a space in order to dance, and then departing. 

Prayer is ritual in the sense that it has structure, so it makes sense  to see it in terms of beginning, middle, end.  This structure can be extended outwards too: we could draw detailed corespondances, eg, mapping of the petitions in the Our Father Prayer to the seven parts of the human being or the spiritual path or reality.   In addition, we can associate gestures with the various sections.  These are ways of layering significance, and the more significance, the more potent.  

God is simultaneoulsy immanent and transcendent.  This can be seen as an impossibility, but the impossible is not necessarily non-real.  It could also be that God’s immanence is actually a *result* of His transcendence; because He is not limited by space or time, He can be present in all spaces and times simultaneously.  That said, God is infinitely potent, sufficiently so to create the whole of the multiverse, so all of this just seems like a paradox. 

God holds the entire ground of our life, but God is also fully other to our life.  This is likely reflected in Christ’s words on the cross, where he contemplates his having been abandoned.  So we are always fully united and separated from god.  But if we are always both, maybe the start of the prayer would be our acknowledgment of consciously entering, and the end of consciously departing or seperating to do God’s work.  In transcendenal meditation. there’s the notion that we enter meditation in order to enter bliss consciousness, and then afterwards we depart into the world to share whatever positive effects of that experience remain.  Or as in church, when after the ritual of mass, the priest says, go out and do god’s work.  

another way of seeing it is the move from being enmeshed in worldly discourse, the concerns of everyday life, of turning away from that, and entering into an other-worldly discourse.  In ashatanga Yoga, the first 3-4 branches are related to being in the world, so checking in with things you should and shouldn’t be doing, and checking in with movement and breathing.  The 5th branch is to do with the practice of turning away from it all (dhamadi?) 6) focusing on an inner point 7) extending the time doing this 8) becoming both united and divided (samadhi)?

It highlights a fascinating tension: we might be in the One conceptually, but to experience a relationship, we psychologically need that temporary separation of 'I' and 'Thou.'  

Your note on the Monad actually got me thinking about Aquinas. He deals with that exact tension: the idea that we are somehow both 'inside' and 'outside' of divinity at the same time.

I really relate to your idea of prayer as a 'stepping out.' For me, that shift happens the moment I address divinity by name; it moves me from normal consciousness into a state of 'discourse.' 

Usually, the content of that discourse is just wishing the absolute best luck and health to whoever comes into my mind—regardless of how I typically feel about them. I’ve found that specific practice to be incredibly healing.

In that light, 'Amen' feels like a signature to me. It’s the way we seal the letter and deliver the statement so we can rejoin the dance.

Hey, thanks! I can listen to this tonight, or this week. 

I’m curious how the podcast uses the word "Monad." It has a few meanings, but at its heart, it means "one." That "one" can refer to a single indivisible unit (like a soul) or the absolute Whole from which all things come.

Your point about the ritual of prayer—entering a space to dance and then departing—really resonates. It highlights a fascinating tension: even if we are conceptually "in the One," we psychologically need a temporary separation of "I" and "Thou" to experience relationship.

This reminds me of Aquinas. He deals with the paradox that God is simultaneously immanent (holding the ground of our life) and transcendent (fully "other"). It seems impossible, but perhaps God’s immanence is actually a result of His transcendence: because He is not limited by space or time, He can be present in all spaces and times simultaneously.

So, while we are always united with the Divine, the act of prayer is a specific shift. It’s like the "withdrawal" in Ashtanga Yoga (Pratyahara)—turning away from the noise of worldly discourse to enter an "other-worldly" discourse.

For me, that shift happens the moment I address divinity by name. Usually, the content of that discourse is just wishing the absolute best luck and health to whoever comes into my mind—regardless of how I typically feel about them. I’ve found that specific practice - simple gratitude - to be healing.

In that light, "Amen" feels like a signature.  But I also like your idea of it being a request to rejoin the cosmos. It reminds me of the end of Mass ("Go and do God's work") or the end of meditation, where you depart the state of bliss to share the effects with the world. We step out of the dance so we can carry the music back into the room.  Nice!
