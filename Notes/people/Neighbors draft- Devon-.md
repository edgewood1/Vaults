# Neighbors draft: Devon:


Hey Iza and Jack, 

I wanted to share a few insights that I hope you could also share with Joe, next door (I don’t have his contact ~ could you share that with me if you have it?)

As you likely know, Devin Solow (founder of BETTER Properties) picked up the property at 411-413 W. Markham for about $300k. After a major renovation, he **repositioned** it specifically for student housing, setting up a **long-term master lease** with a disaffiliated Duke fraternity, and sold the property for 1.2 million using that evergreen lease agreement as the main **value driver**, essentially presenting it as a "turnkey" business to an investor who wanted the guaranteed cash flow that comes with a fraternity-backed lease.  The new owners are a couple based in Charlotte, NC who are regularly on the market for such properties and are difficult to contact (unlike Devon). 

Devon just purchased the old church at **601 W. Markham Ave** and demoed it.  Based on the property's specific zoning, the owner’s stated business strategy, and the lot's location, the most likely development is a **high-density residential infill project** designed for the student or rental market.

he situation at **601 W. Markham Ave** appears to be following a similar playbook. After purchasing the former church site for $280,000, Devon cleared the lot in late 2025, essentially creating a blank canvas for a high-density "urban infill" project. Given the property's **RU-M (Multifamily)** zoning, he isn't restricted to building a single-family home. Instead, his business model—which he describes as studying the city's development code "line by line"—suggests he will likely build a **high-occupancy duplex or triplex**. Because this is a "by-right" development, he can maximize the number of bedrooms and renters without needing a public hearing or neighborhood approval.
For our street, the likely intention is to create another "turnkey" rental engine geared toward students. While the building itself will likely be marketed as "luxury," the impact on Trinity Park is often the opposite. By prioritizing the "bedroom count" to increase his **Return on Investment (ROI)**, we are looking at the potential for significant parking congestion and the same transient, high-intensity use that we’ve seen with the fraternity house nearby. Essentially, the strategy seems to be "repositioning" our residential blocks into a decentralized dorm system, trading the quiet of a historic neighborhood for maximum rental yield.
**Fact Check & Confirmation**

It’s more likely this will be a duplex or triplex designed to maximize bedroom count.  

If your priority is a **quiet, family-oriented residential feel**, this development will likely be a **negative**. It introduces a "commercial rental" intensity into a residential block.
Solow’s model is built on "disrupting" traditional neighborhoods by inserting high-revenue rentals where they didn't exist before. Since he has already shown a willingness to rent to groups that disturb neighbors (the fraternity), he is unlikely to prioritize "neighborhood character" over his Return on Investment (ROI).

It is important to be realistic: since the property is already zoned RU-M, he has a "by-right" ability to build multifamily housing. He doesn't need to ask for permission to be a developer, but he is required to be a responsible neighbor and landlord.
The most effective way to approach this in your email is to frame it as a request for professional management rather than an attack on development itself. You can bridge your concerns by pointing out that the "success" of his first project has come at a high cost to the people living next to it.
Here is a concise addition or revision to the end of your letter that incorporates those specific "behavioral" patterns as a cautionary tale:
The Management Gap
While new investment in Trinity Park is generally a positive, there is a growing concern regarding how these high-density "infill" projects are managed after the dust settles. At his nearby property on Markham, we’ve seen a shift from residential living to what functions more like a commercial transit hub. The neighborhood has had to deal with a recurring "departure window" between midnight and 2:30 AM, where the street becomes a bottleneck for party buses and Ubers, paired with chronic waste mismanagement and the "seasonal mounds" of trash that often accompany high-turnover student rentals.

Our hope for 601 W. Markham is that the development leans toward a more balanced "missing middle" housing model—perhaps for professionals or long-term residents—rather than another "ghost residence" or party house. The goal isn't to stop the building, but to ensure that the operational management of the site doesn't once again force the neighbors to become the primary "code enforcers" for issues like public nuisance and basic sanitation.

While Devon has his own plans that he’s likely invested much time and money into, it’s the hope of many that he doesn’t just repeat the model of creating a master lease for yet another fraternity and instead is more thoughtful about hwo he rents out to.   due to the influx of professionals and non-fraternity students, it’s easy to rent property out, so why insist on a fraternity, which might have the perk of a 10 year lease, does so at the expense of the community.  

This expense includes excess trash, noise disruptions.
