# Mark topics


That’s a really kind instinct, especially given the life shift he’s in. A gentle, spacious check-in that doesn’t feel like an interrogation is exactly right. Here’s a **topic / question menu** you can pull from—pick a few that feel natural and let the convo breathe.

⸻

**1) Wilbur + Lily (family heartbeat)**
	•	“How’s Wilbur these days? What’s he into right now?”
	•	“Any new milestones that surprised you?”
	•	“How’s Lily doing? How’s she feeling lately?”
	•	“What’s been the sweetest part of this phase so far?”
	•	“What’s been harder than you expected?”

*(These invite stories, not just updates.)*

⸻

**2) Fatherhood (inner shift, not just logistics)**
	•	“How has becoming a dad changed you, if at all?”
	•	“Anything about fatherhood that caught you off guard?”
	•	“What’s felt most meaningful about it so far?”
	•	“Do you feel like you’ve found your footing yet, or still figuring it out?”

⸻

**3) Time, recreation, and identity**
	•	“Do you get any time that still feels like *your* time?”
	•	“What does recreation look like now—same stuff, totally different, or on pause?”
	•	“Anything you miss from before, or anything you don’t miss at all?”
	•	“Have your priorities shifted in ways you didn’t expect?”

⸻

**4) Home + practical life**
	•	“How’s the house situation these days?”
	•	“Is the place starting to feel more settled / kid-shaped?”
	•	“Any projects around the house you’re in the middle of—or avoiding?”
	•	“Still happy with where you’re living?”

⸻

**5) Mind + interests (keeping the adult self alive)**
	•	“Are you reading anything at all these days—or is that on hold?”
	•	“Any new projects or ideas floating around?”
	•	“What’s been energizing you lately, even in small ways?”
	•	“Anything you’re hoping to get back to when things slow down?”

⸻

**6) Friendship + reconnection (optional but meaningful)**
	•	“I know life’s been full—just wanted to check in and stay connected.”
	•	“I miss our talks and wanted to see how you’re really doing.”
	•	“Would love to catch up sometime, even if it’s low-key.”

⸻

**A tone tip**

You don’t need to ask all of these. Two or three, with genuine listening, is more than enough. Framing things as **curiosity, not catching up on missed obligations**, keeps it warm and pressure-free.

If you want, I can also help you turn this into:
	•	a **single natural text**, or
	•	a **short voice-note script**, or
	•	a **longer email-style check-in**
