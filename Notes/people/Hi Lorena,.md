# Hi Lorena,

     Hi Lorena, 

On 1/27,  I emailed you my Fidelity Investments (unitedHealth care) insurance card; since I never heard that the policy was rejected, I assumed it was paying for all our meetings.  Since it’s not in my budget to pay the full fee, I wouldn’t have scheduled so many meetings if I had known my insurance was not going to cover it. 

If there’s anything more you can try with that old insurance plan, then please do.  

I started a new insurance on 8/1.  I can email you that card soon.  It looks like our last 2 meetings (8/1, 8/24) could be applied to that new insurance.  

Let me know how you want to move forward with this.  

Thanks!
Mel

     - I assumed that since we were meeting, the plan was covering everything; Unfortunately, I wouldn’t have continued meeting if I knew about an out-of-pocket charge.

     - Could we settle 50-50?

     - 120*8 = 960; so 480?

     - Charge the August visits to the new insurance
