For the letter to Devon, the goal is to be "firm but fair." You want to acknowledge his success as a developer (which builds rapport) while clearly stating that the neighborhood is watching the 601 project closely. Framing it as an opportunity for him to "set a new standard" is usually more effective than starting with a list of demands.
Subject: Neighborhood welcome & thoughts on 601 W. Markham
Hi Devin,
I hope your 2026 is off to a great start.
I’m reaching out as a neighbor in Trinity Park regarding your new project at 601 W. Markham. We’ve seen the church demolition and the lot clearing, and there’s a lot of interest on the block regarding what’s coming next for that corner.
First, I want to acknowledge the work you did at 411-413 W. Markham. It was a major undertaking, and the valuation you achieved upon the sale was certainly an impressive proof of concept for "missing middle" housing in Durham.
As you move into the development phase for 601, I’m writing to ask you to consider a different tenant model than the one used at 411. While the master lease with a fraternity likely offered great financial security, it has created some significant operational challenges for those of us living nearby. Between the midnight "departure windows" for transit and the ongoing struggles with waste management, the intensity of that specific use has been tough on the street’s quality of life.
Given the current influx of professionals and grad students to the area, we believe 601 is a perfect candidate for a more community-conscious rental model. We’d love to see the property house residents who are looking for a long-term home in a quiet neighborhood rather than a high-turnover "mini-dorm" environment.
We are excited to see new life on that corner and hope you’ll use this project as an opportunity to prove that high-density infill can coexist peacefully with the historic, family-oriented character of Trinity Park. We would love to hear more about your plans for the site and the type of management style you're envisioning.
Best regards,
Mel

Why this works:
 * The "Compliment Sandwich": You acknowledge his $1.2M exit at 411. Developers love to be recognized for their "wins," and it makes him less defensive when you pivot to the problems.
 * Professional Language: Using terms like "operational challenges" and "intensity of use" sounds more objective than "it's too loud and there's trash everywhere."
 * The Pivot: You aren't telling him not to make money; you're suggesting a different market (professionals/grad students) that provides a high return with lower "wear and tear" on the neighborhood reputation.
Would you like me to draft a more formal version of this to send to the City Council as a "heads up" about the site’s development, or should we wait to see if Devon responds first?
