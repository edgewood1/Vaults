# Fraternity issues list



Based on your correspondence with Elinor Landess (Duke Director of Off-Campus & Community Life) regarding the properties at 411 and 415 W. Markham Ave., here is a detailed list of the recurring problems associated with the fraternity:
Noise Disturbances
 * Late-Night Gathering and Departures: The primary disruption occurs between midnight and 2:00 AM as large groups leave parties. This involves significant shouting, loud conversations, and the slamming of car doors.
 * Intermittent Disruptions: Noise is often "intermittent" rather than constant, with spikes of yelling or loud music that last for about 10 minutes before subsiding as a ride departs, making it difficult for police to witness firsthand.
 * Transportation Noise: A high volume of Ubers (up to 15 at peak times) and rented party buses—some playing loud music—line the street in both directions, causing traffic congestion and noise.
 * Daytime Events: Large gatherings occur during weekend afternoons for sporting events or ceremonies, involving hours of continuous yelling, cheering, and chanting.
 * Street Loitering: Students frequently linger in the street while waiting for transportation, extending the duration of the disturbance.
Public Nuisance & Conduct Issues
 * Public Urination: During large events (e.g., a gathering of over 30 students), individuals have been observed urinating on the side of the house in view of the street.
 * Trash Accumulation: The residents consistently disregard the property, leading to overflowing city trash cans and bags of trash left in storage areas. Debris frequently litters both the yard and the street.
 * Severe Graduation Debris: Around graduation, trash accumulation becomes extreme, often forming a large "mound" that remains for weeks until a dumpster is brought in.
 * Evasive Behavior: When approached by neighbors, students have been described as "evasive," often claiming not to live at the property.
Property Use Concerns
 * "Party House" Reputation: The frequency of disturbances is high enough that local Uber drivers recognize the addresses specifically as the "party house".
 * Misuse of Space: Units that were described by student contacts as "vacant" appear to be used primarily as dedicated party spaces rather than residences.
 * Scale of Gatherings: Events often involve well over 30 attendees, which is disproportionate to the residential capacity of the duplexes.
Impact on Neighborhood Quality of Life
 * Sleep Deprivation: Residents have had to resort to earplugs, sound machines, and soundproof window inserts to mitigate the noise, though sleep disruption still occurs.
 * Constant Turnover: The "ongoing nature" of the problem is exacerbated by the fact that a new group of students moves in every August, leading to a repetitive cycle of issues over the last three to four years.
 * Safety and Accessibility: The volume of parked vehicles and Ubers creates traffic issues that affect the ease of street access for other neighbors.

Chronology of Fraternity-Related Issues (411 & 415 W. Markham)
1. The "Departure Window" (12:00 AM – 2:30 AM)
Rather than a single noise event, the end of the night creates a sustained period of neighborhood instability characterized by:
 * Intermittent Disruptions: The disturbance is rhythmic rather than constant; noise spikes for 10–15 minutes as groups exit, followed by brief lulls, making it difficult for Durham Police to catch the peak volume during a standard drive-by.
 * Logistical Congestion: A massive influx of Ubers (often 10–15 vehicles at once) and oversized party buses line both sides of the street, effectively turning a residential block into a commercial transit hub.
 * Street Loitering: Large groups of students linger in the public right-of-way while waiting for rides, leading to shouting, door slamming, and amplified music from idling vehicles.
2. Chronic Waste and Property Neglect
The residents treat the property as a venue rather than a residence, leading to significant environmental issues:
 * Systemic Trash Mismanagement: A persistent disregard for city sanitation schedules, resulting in overflowing bins, loose bags left in storage areas, and debris (cups, cans, flyers) blowing into the street and neighboring yards.
 * Seasonal "Mounds": Extreme accumulation occurs during transition periods like Graduation, where massive piles of furniture and trash sit for weeks, necessitating private dumpsters to clear the blight.
3. Public Nuisance and Illegal Conduct
 * Public Urination: Multiple instances of students using the side of the house or yard as a restroom in full view of the street and neighbors.
 * Evasive Accountability: When neighbors attempt to address issues directly, residents are frequently evasive or claim they do not live at the address, suggesting the units are being used as dedicated "party houses" or "ghost" residences rather than traditional student housing.
 * Scale of Assembly: Afternoon events (ceremonies or game days) involve 30+ individuals, far exceeding the reasonable occupancy or "quiet enjoyment" expectations for a residential duplex.
4. Cumulative Impact on Residents
 * New Resident Cycle: Because the "fraternity" cycle resets every August with new tenants, the burden of "re-educating" the house falls entirely on the neighbors, leading to a permanent state of hyper-vigilance.
 * Quality of Life Mitigation: Neighbors have been forced to invest in soundproofing (window inserts, white noise machines) to maintain a basic standard of living, yet sleep deprivation remains a recurring issue due to the 2:00 AM departure peaks.
Would you like me to take this list and draft the formal letter to the city, or should we refine these points further first?

 * Evasive Accountability: When neighbors attempt to address issues directly, residents are evasive and are quick to deny.  They have also offered their phone number for neighbors in case there any issues, but they never respond to our attempts at reaching out.  Finally, they also claim that one of the apartments is unrented, despite it being used as a party space.    
 * Scale of Assembly: Afternoon events (ceremonies or game days) involve 30+ individuals, far exceeding the reasonable occupancy or "quiet enjoyment" expectations for a residential duplex.
