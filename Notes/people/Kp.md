Multiple personality
Exclusion from conversation
Felt some apathy from yr mom
Felt towards whole group apathy.  Same I’m starting to feel towards finas people. 
What happened to melody meeting?
Animosity between she and fina.  How to get a page from my book or get me involved before you lose your temper.  
Her pull phone from me.   That’s a first.  Happens within an hour of their leaving.   Also I wasn’t to happy with how she was during the party.  Fina that is
Moms comment about her not watching Disney with her as if I’m behind that.
