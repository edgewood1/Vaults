Can you tell me about the ornaments on the tree? 
- cedars tree
- Heirloom ornaments from both families. 
- Mom offers Xmas pjs for both - a tradition.

What are some of the projects you engage in here? 

- Sewing space setting: make curtains, pillows for house.

- Convert the coop into a Kitchen for dying.  Dying example: 
- The napkins dyed with Black-eyed Susan’s, cosmos, madder root.  The flowers were picked last summer and preseed in the freezer until they were ready to use.  
- Napkins black eyed Susan cosmos picked summer froze.  Madder root.   Other times sassafras’s  marigold
- The idea is that freezing plants breaks the cell structure and allows the natural colors to release when you add water. So what I did on my second attempt was to freeze the flower petals in water, then let it thaw out and strain out the solids. 

What do you like about this place?

She finds the farm fascinating.

She studied environmentalism, but has always explored farms, but didn’t have the courage to step in that direction until Mark gave her that as an example 
- courage to explore
