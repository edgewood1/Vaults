Hey!

It sounds like we share a common history: navigating a chunk of adulthood where money was scarce, but food, shelter, and a wealth of experience were always within reach. 

Perhaps that subcultural life kept Babylon at a safe enough distance, but looking back, I can see it was always lurking in the shadows cast by my family, who reveled in cruel figures like Rush Limbaugh and Jerry Springer.  To them, these provided the weapons and armor needed to take on the world, an approach they seemed to take pride in.  For me, I could only sense degrees of fear and hypocrisy, and the lifestyle I would define my own against, so in this sense it was always unconsciously present, likely sabotaging much. 

It’s easy to imagine that life built around resistances as one marked by a series of spell-castings.  I also wonder if I could resurrect such spells just by writing about that life, but its so much easier these days, with the full-time demands of work, family, and home, to simply slip back into the world of streaming services: skin-deep tv shows and movies.  As I get older and more exhausted, there’s much I’m willing to watch, so long as there is a passable degree of plot or character development.   In writing, I see that I’m just letting a different version of my family’s shadow in. 

But as Fina grows older, I see in her a life I want to cultivate and nourish.  She is the exact opposite of what these shows and even music represent.  I’m even surprised when I see how even youth-oriented programming can be laced with subtle incitements toward sex and drugs. I wonder about the history of this programming, the tradition behind it, unfriendly to life, marked by proto-fascist impulses and the myth of Cain as its standard bearer, all opposed to the vision of the world as a living, sacred whole.

I wonder if resistance might be simply a matter of faith-cultivation, and if faith cultivation might be the building of inner spaces through all manner of imagery.  However it’s imagined, it likely means stepping away from digital life and all the habits we’ve accumulated around it.  

It could also be the faith-cultivation is just something that becomes more common as we age; as the physical and social body begins to fade, as we’re presented with the option and abilities to pour more of ourselves into these imaginal spaces as a balm for the present and also a practice for what comes after, the next set of bardos, full of their own set of obstacles and "wrathful deities" that we’re supposed to recognize as the "thought-forms" or "karmic residues" of the life we lived, the emanations of our own mind. 

I was just looking into this business of bardos, and I was surprised how in Tibetan tradition there are 6 total - the 3 of life and the 3 of death, and that in this life we are weaving constantly through 3 simultaneously: those of waking, dreaming, and meditation.   Bardo means “between two”  a transition or interval, and the Tibetans see every moment of our lives as a transition or interval state, as sort of passing from death to rebirth, if we could bring our perception to this level.  The Tibetan book of the dead describes this as the “liberation through hearing” which I would modify to be the “liberation through perception”.
