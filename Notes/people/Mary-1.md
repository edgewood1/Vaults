Emanation is is only one part of equation.  There is also creationism.  What’s difference.  Latter is something from nothing.  Also that which unfolds is creation which is distinct from creator. 

We live out our lives in the Mind of the universe, and for thousands of years, philosophers, theologians, and scientists have called that unitary source of reality at the beginning of time—the Monad. In philosophy, it’s the etheric Substance at the root of both mind and matter. For theologians, the Monad is the *logos* or Word of God. In science, it’s the Big Bang singularity from which the physical universe emerged. In mathematics, the Monad is defined as the zero-point origin of all numbers.
In your life, the Monad is the singularity in your own consciousness, the point of view from which you experience the world. The commonplace experience of being a single point of awareness in your own mind—of being impeccably whole in your own little world—is a reflection of the Monad in you.
This is Chapter 2 of the book *In the Mind of the Universe: The Monad and You!* by Dennis William Hauck. Read by Peter Simmons. More information on Amazon at  **[https://amzn.to/489vk5H](https://amzn.to/489vk5H)**

We are not in god like a fish in the ocean bc god is other
