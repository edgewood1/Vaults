Hey John!

Sorry this took so long.   

Our primary university liaison is Elinor Landess, the Director at the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards. 

She already has a file on the frat across the street and has been really responsive to our concerns.

In the past, she’s actually often encouraged us to call the police since the police typically share their reports with her office.  You can also send  her any photos / videos.  Both give substance to any of her follow-up actions since the students live in a constant state of denial. 

Today, I’ll actually be sending her a photo of this week’s trash situation since it seems to happen at the start and end of every semester (One bag of overflow allowed, and lids remain shut).  They end up with 10 bags of overflow that is never really collected and sits outside their apartment until a  private contractor picks it up.  It was also a spilled overflow bag that caused the Styrofoam issue the other week. 

I’ve attached the Good Neighbor Program flyer below—this is what Elinor tries to hand-deliver to the house at the start of each semester to lay out the expectations for noise and conduct.  There’s also a flyer I put together with one of the old neighbors.
