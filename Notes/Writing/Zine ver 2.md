**I. The Search for Constancy**

Your branches sway in the wind, settle into stillness, and then move again.  

Your bark is wet in the rain, and dry in the sun.

But where are you amid this continuous change?  Certainly not in the movement or stillness, the wetness or dryness;  if this were so, you would appear and disappear with their comings and goings.

You are other than these - a third reality: a **Constancy** that supports these fleeting changes, an undertow that holds fast.

While you are other than these changes, the changes nevertheless reveal a clue - they reflect your struggle with elements of the world.  The sun, rain, and wind demand answers from you; they invoke and reveal your character, substance, and nature - what is enduring.

* It is your nature to move when the wind blows, and were you not to, I might mistake you for a statue rather than a living being.   

**II. The External Force: The Tension of Becoming** 

I could look at any one of these elements and ask what drives it.

Wind is driven by a  long chain of events related to fluctuations of pressure and heat across time—a history of shifting weather, migration patterns, and celestial mechanics.  It makes you a participant in a vast historical chain of weather and forces.  

But this force is not random; it has purpose.

On a physical level, the air rushes from high to low pressure spaces not because it "likes" to move, but because it seeks rest. It blows to balance the atmosphere (so that the equator doesn’t burn…)

But on a loftier level, we might why such laws should even exist - laws that create wind rather than a stagnant vacuum.  And who creates such laws? What providence? 

The wind distributes heat so the equator does not burn; it strengthens your wood through stress; it carries the rain. The wind seeks rest for itself, but in doing so, it sustains life for you.

**III. The Internal Nature: The Tension of Action** 

The activity (operation) of yours—the bending, the swaying, and the stillness I observe—is an expression of **Power**, a limiting force that prevents the swaying from continuing forever, or too wildly, or dissolving into thin air.  

This power also enables movement itself: A stone would not sway; it would stand rigid or crack.  

And It enables a specific kind of movement - one flexible and anchored: After all, not all things sway when the wind blows: water would not sway, it would scatter. 

In your movement, I sense these limits - the meeting of actual (possible?) and impossible power, of boundlessness and the bounded.  

**IV. The Deep Stability: The Tension of Nature**

If power flows from your nature, that nature itself is a tension of opposing principles: Form (who you are) and Matter (the resistance and fragility of your physicality). 

Matter is extended, tangible space that resists the organizing force of Form. Just as I assume a human body to be born, you—the perfect concept of a Pin Oak—must assume the materials of your specific time and place. A specific Pin Oak is born: unique, fragile, and imperfect.

* Multiplicity: 

This presence of matter allows the form of a "Pin Oak" to be multiplied into a whole forest. 


But it is the Form—this nature—that is the stable undertow I was looking for. It is the law holding you together even as your body undergoes endless change.



**V. The Ultimate Reality: The Tension of Being** 

But what enables this form to exist in the first place? 

What lifts this design out of the darkness of nothingness, making it real?

While form is an active principle, it becomes a passive principle when facing Existence itself —the infinite energy that makes you be, that makes you real.  

In this passive role, it is called Essence.  

Before existence, form / essence acts as the limit to reality.  

It contracts the infinite act of being into the shape of a tree.  Because of this union, you are not just a concept, you stand before me as solid substance against the sky. 

**VI. The Deduction of Higher Forms**

You are a being of matter and spirit. But are you the only kind of reality?

There are likely creatures who lack matter entirely—beings of pure form-essence. They do not share common traits across a species like trees do; rather, each is radically unique, a "species of one" composed only of the tension between who they are and that they are.  

* Is this where we refer to “Lackign matter, there is nothing for the form to imprint itself on…”

We draw this conclusion by observing the Hierarchy of Being. Reality ascends in logical steps: from non-living matter (rocks), to life without senses (plants), to life with senses (animals), to life with intellect (humans). However, there is a vast metaphysical gap between the "Embodied Intellect" of humans and the "Uncreated Pure Intellect" of God. Reason suggests that for the chain of being to be unbroken, this gap must be filled by an intermediate category: Created Pure Intellects, or angels.

Furthermore, we deduce their existence through the Perfection of the Universe. The created world is meant to be a mirror of the Creator. If the universe contained only material beings, it would fail to reflect God's specific nature as Pure Spirit. For creation to fully express the likeness of its Maker, it must include entities that are purely spiritual. Thus, we deduce the existence of these invisible gardeners not by physical observation, but by the necessity of cosmic completeness.

**VII. The Hierarchy: The Visible and Invisible Gardeners & The Circle of Stewardship**

But you do not stand alone in this tension of being. You are sustained by a community of beings.

There are the physical entities that contribute to your well-being: the soil, the rain, and the sun. 

But the order of the world suggests there are also non-physical entities in this equation—nonphysical entities that lack matter entirely.

They contribute to the providential order, allowing creatures as fragile as us to thrive in a universe of forces.

**VIII. The Circle of Stewardship**

I look first to the ancient history written in your bark. Even the stars play a role; they fuse hydrogen into the carbon and nitrogen that now make up your frame. The life cycle of a star has as its purpose the creation of the elements required for life. In exploding, they scattered the fuel that now builds your branches.

Then I look to the elements. The sun does not shine for itself—it has no eyes to see its light—it shines so that you may grow. The wind distributes heat so the equator does not burn; it strengthens your wood through stress, spreads your pollen, and carries the rain.

Then I look to the vegetation. Plants, trees, and grass exist to capture this raw energy and convert it into the food and shelter that sustains Animal Life.

In turn, the animals provide the food, labor, companionship, and ecological stability required for rational intelligence to flourish.

Elements generate consciousness, and consciousness is designed to contemplate the Creator, to know and love the Source.

**IX.  The Circle of Care: Why the High Serve the Low** 

But this hierarchy is not a pyramid of consumption; it is a cycle of care.

People eat, but they also garden.  

God, as the highest entity, does not consume; He pours Himself out into the world. Thus, the defining character of the Good is giving rather than taking. Creatures aligned with the Good must give more than they take. 

 Higher forms are supported so they may act as stewards, engaging in a reciprocal relation. Soil serves trees, and trees serve soil; animals serve the forest, and the forest shelters the animals. In a sense, the tree extends the care it receives from the animal back down into the earth. Likewise, the care we receive from the world, we must pour back into it: protecting the soil and preserving the forest through gardening, conservation, and love.

**X. The Center and the song**

Finally, I realize God is at the center. All creations are spokes on the wheel of existence. He touches the atom just as directly as He touches the Archangel; you possess your own direct, secret relationship with your Creator.

In fact, in your quietude, you might be "more aware" of Him than I am. 

My free will allows me to be distracted, delusional, or anxious. I can say "No" to the good. You, however, possess a quiet perfection—a constant, ontological prayer of obedience that we, with our noisy minds, often struggle to achieve.

You cannot sin. Like a rock obeying gravity, you obey the laws of your nature with 100% perfection. While you lack intellectual awareness, you possess Ontological Awareness. You exist without resistance.

So I depend on you. It is my duty to recognize your quietude, learn from it, and serve God from there.
