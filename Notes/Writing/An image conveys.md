# An image conveys


An image that involves glistening, slithering, or hissing provoke negative emotion and instill a need for caution.

One that involves cooing  and fumbling instill positive emotion and instill a need to provide care..


Where does such “programming” come from?  While it’s true that we are socialized with stories of snakes as dangerous or evil, we speak of a response that is prior to language:

1. Ancestral experience - a genetic trauma passed down as instinct from a time when we were more easily traumatized by any negative experience
2. Do we have an unconsciousn cellular memory that involves the capacity of slithering movements and its ability to penetrate barriers and infect bodies? Does this memory inform judgments via analogy?
PRESENCE

There are some images that provoke a confounding mixture of positive and negative emotion.  

1. Mysterium- to see the other as mysterious / extraordinary such that our ultimate response is silence
2. Tremendum - we’re overwhelmed by the sheer power inherent in the phenomenon, which provokes a terror
3. Fascinas - we’re attracted by the grace / mercy by which such a power is expressed
To see the other in an extraordinary way that instills both a fascination and terror that leaves us silent.  

Is this a response to the numinous “core” of an object? If so, why don’t we experience all things in this way? If we did, we wouldn’t be able to act in the world.  Socialization makes all things ordinary.  It hides its numinosity.  But on occasion, we see an object from a particular perspective that this numinosity surfaces of its own accord.   

If we find ourselves on a raft in the middle of the Indian Ocean, we may catch a glimpse of the sheer power and size and beauty of the water body, and the way it seems to allow our seemingly insignificant being continued existence.  

However, some might find themselves in such a situation and never have this experience.  In which case, maybe the analogy to a spiritual intervention is more appropriate.  In both cases, it is the experience of an inherent power piercing a facade and presenting itself to the perceiver. 

FOOTNOTES

NATURAL / CULTURAL OBJECTS

Cultural objects are man-made; natural objects are not. 

NATURAL OBJECTS
1. These include living, dying, and dead objects. 
2. All three are instilled by divine forms, although each kind of object have forms of a different nature.  Dead objects have a light turned towards its internal form; living objects have a light turned primarily towards the world.  

CULTURAL OBJECTS

1. Natural materials transformed by people, who instill their form into such matter. A walking stick hand-carved from a branch.  In addition, such an object could be instilled with a “potentized” form - ie, a hex or blessing.
2. Synthetic materials transformed by machines that instill forms whose genesis is people. A mass-produced plastic walking stick.
3. Natural or synthetic materials electrified: computers

All three cultural objects contain divine form, but such form is shared with imposed human form/intent as well as “sub-human” form/intent

These objects “bear the marks” of their surroundings.
