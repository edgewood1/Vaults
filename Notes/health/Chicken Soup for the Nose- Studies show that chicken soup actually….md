Chicken Soup for the Nose. Studies show that chicken soup actually contains ingredients that help thin mucus and decrease the amount of nose-congesting white blood cells. And it tastes pretty good too

A <u>[humidifier](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322228#dryness-and-humidity)</u>, especially a <u>[cool mist](https://wheatoncollege.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/URI.pdf)</u> one, keeps the air moist. This can help ease a dry cough and may reduce congestion, particularly at night. Try putting a humidifier in the child’s room.
Make sure the child is not alone with the humidifier and does not treat it as a toy. Keep the humidifier clean, since mold can easily grow in wet spaces

allergies](https://peds-ent.com/4-steps-to-help-reduce-your-childs-allergy-symptoms/) are the most common cause of stuffy noses. For children with nasal allergies, harmless substances like pollen and pet dander kick off an inflammatory immune response that makes the body behave like it has a constant, mild cold

the adenoids become chronically infected by bacteria or constantly inflamed by allergens. This causes the adenoids to swell, or become hypertrophic, blocking air flow between the nose and the windpipe in the throat. The sensation can be similar to a stuffy nose.
