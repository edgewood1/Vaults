# Jobs


what are the top 20 job positions that have seen the greatest increase in openings and foresee more increases in the future











Renewable energy, healthcare, and data science currently dominate the fastest-growing job market. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2024–2034 projections, **Wind Turbine Service Technicians** and **Solar Photovoltaic Installers** are the top two positions, while healthcare roles account for nearly half of the top 20 list due to an aging U.S. population. 
The following list ranks the top 20 occupations by projected percentage growth rate (2024–2034).

**Key Trends & Emerging Roles for 2026**
While the BLS data tracks long-term stability, immediate hiring trends for 2026 emphasize specific niche skills, particularly in Artificial Intelligence. 
* **The "Green" Boom:** The push for clean energy has made **Wind** and **Solar** technicians the undisputed leaders in percentage growth. These roles often require vocational training rather than four-year degrees.
* **AI & Tech Specialization:** While "Data Scientist" is #4, LinkedIn’s 2026 specific "Jobs on the Rise" list highlights even more specialized emerging titles not yet tracked broadly by the BLS, such as **AI Engineers**, **AI Consultants**, and **Data Annotators**.
* **Healthcare Dominance:** 12 of the top 20 roles are in healthcare. **Nurse Practitioners**(#3) are increasingly serving as primary care providers, driving massive demand. **Home Health Aides** (#18) are notable because, while their percentage growth is 17%, they are projected to add the **most total new jobs** (over 700,000) of any occupation.
* **Cybersecurity:** With the rise of digital infrastructure, **Information Security Analysts**(#5) remain critical, protecting expanding cloud and AI systems from cyber threats.

so is software developer roles on the rise? the media gives the perception that is declining and hyper-competitive due to layoffs and AI presence










Yes, the field is growing, but the "easy entry" era is over. The perception of a decline is real for specific segments of the market, particularly entry-level roles, creating a "two-speed" industry.
While the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects **15–16% growth** for software developers through 2034 (adding nearly 300,000 new jobs), the market has fundamentally shifted away from generalist coding toward specialized engineering.
Here is why the data contradicts the "death of coding" narrative, yet validates the difficulty you may be seeing:

**1. The "Junior" Crisis vs. Senior Shortage**
The market has split into two distinct realities:
* **Entry-Level Decline:** Hiring for junior developers has dropped significantly (some data shows a **13% decline** since 2022). AI tools like GitHub Copilot can now handle the basic boilerplate code that used to be the training ground for new grads. This has removed the "bottom rung" of the career ladder.
* **Senior/Specialized Boom:** Companies are desperate for **Senior Engineers**, **AI Architects**, and **Security Specialists** who can *audit* AI code rather than just write it. There is a projected shortage of experienced talent, meaning senior roles remain highly competitive *for employers*, not candidates.

**2. AI is Changing the Role, Not Erasing It**
AI is not replacing developers; it is raising the barrier to entry.
* **Old Role:** Writing syntax, fixing syntax errors, building basic CRUD apps. (Declining)
* **New Role (2026):** Designing system architecture, ensuring AI security, managing cloud infrastructure, and prompting AI agents. (Rising)
* **Result:** The job title "Software Engineer" is evolving into "AI Systems Architect." The sheer volume of code generated by AI actually requires *more* humans to test, secure, and integrate it.

**3. Why It Wasn't in the "Top 20" List**
The "Top 20" list typically ranks jobs by **percentage growth**, not total new jobs.
* **Niche vs. Massive:** A niche field like "Wind Turbine Technician" can grow 50% by adding only 5,000 jobs.
* **Software Scale:** Software development is so massive (over 1.6 million jobs) that a "modest" 15% growth rate equals **~270,000+ new positions**. In terms of *raw opportunity*, it arguably beats almost every job on the Top 20 list, even if its *percentage* speed is slower.

**Summary of the 2026 Landscape**

| Market Segment                                                                       | Status                                                                               | Why?                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bootcamp Grads / Juniors                                                             | Declining / Hyper-Competitive                                                        | AI automates basic tasks; layoffs flooded market with experienced seniors.           |
| Mid-Level / Senior Devs                                                              | Stable / Growing                                                                     | Complex system design and "human in the loop" verification cannot be automated yet.  |
| AI & Data Engineers                                                                  | Explosive Growth                                                                     | Every company is trying to integrate AI models, requiring specialized coding skills. |

**Verdict:** Software development is not dying, but it has **matured**. The days of getting a high-paying job after a 3-month bootcamp are largely gone. The new market rewards those who specialize in **AI integration, cybersecurity, or backend architecture** rather than general web development.

What soft skills are crucial for developers in 2026, especially with AI?

What AI technologies are creating these specialized roles?

I'd like to see how AI is impacting other industries

































i would qualify as a mid-level/senior dev.  i started as a junior in 2019.   after attending a code school.  However, I’ve been a slow learner.  However, I am an older coder (55) even though I look younger (45).  So i have 6 years of experience and currently do work with copilot, so have experience with prompt engineering.  My current position I’ve had for 3.5 years and I’ve been thinking about looking around because there’s no upward mobility in my current role.  Woudl this be a good time to do that, that is, have enough juniors not found jobs in the field long enough to move on to other fields, or should stay at my current role another year just to hone cloud and ai skills and general interview/coding skills a little more?













Yes, you should start looking now. Do not wait another year.
Your specific profile—**6 years of experience + current AI workflow familiarity**—places you in the "safe zone" of the 2026 market. The "junior crisis" you read about largely does not apply to you. In fact, your age and "slow learner" style may actually align better with the industry's new direction than you realize.
Here is the strategic breakdown of why you should test the market immediately rather than waiting:

**1. You Are in the "Sweet Spot" (Mid/Senior)**
The market is currently "two-speed":
* **Juniors (0–3 years):** Facing a crisis. AI can do their basic tasks, and companies are hiring fewer of them.
* **Mid/Seniors (5+ years):** In high demand. Companies need experienced eyes to **review** AI code, design architectures, and spot security flaws.
	* **Why this favors you:** You have 6 years of context. The market is desperate for people who can *orchestrate* code, not just type it.

**2. Your "Slow Learner" Trait is Now Less of a Liability**
In the pre-AI era, "fast coding" was a primary metric. In 2026, AI provides the speed. The new bottleneck is **Judgment** and **Verification**. 
* **The Shift:** Companies don't need you to memorize syntax quickly anymore; they need you to look at AI-generated code and say, *"That will break when we scale,"* or *"That’s a security risk."***Your Advantage:** "Slow" often means "deliberate." Your 6 years of experience combined with your life maturity (55) likely means you have better risk assessment than a 24-year-old "fast" coder. Position yourself as a **Code Auditor** or **Stability-Focused Engineer**.

**3. Your "Prompt Engineering" Skill is a Current Asset**
You mentioned you *already* use Copilot and know prompt engineering.
* **Market Reality:** Many senior devs are stubborn and *refuse* to use these tools. You are ahead of them.
* **Selling Point:** You can market yourself as an **"AI-Native Developer"**—someone who knows how to force-multiply their output using tools. This directly counters any age bias by showing you are on the cutting edge of workflow modernization. 

**4. The Cost of Waiting (Stagnation Risk)**
You mentioned your current role has "no upward mobility."
* **The Trap:** If you stay another year to "hone skills" in a vacuum, you risk training on the *wrong* things. The best way to learn Cloud/AI architecture is to work in a company that is actively deploying it.
* **Interview Lag:** Hiring cycles for seniors in 2026 are longer and more rigorous. If you start looking now, it might take 3–6 months to find the right fit anyway. If you wait a year to *start*, you are pushing your move to 2027–2028. 

**Recommended Strategy: The "Passive" Pivot**
Don't quit your job. Instead, launch a **low-pressure search**:
1. **Update Your Resume:** Highlight **"AI-Assisted Development"** and **"Code Review/Quality Assurance"** as primary skills. Mention your 6 years of experience prominently.
7. **Target "Boring" Industries:** Look at Healthcare, Insurance, or Manufacturing (the sectors from the "Top 20" list). They value stability and maturity over "hustle culture" and often prefer older, reliable developers.
9. **Leverage the "Senior" Label:** Apply to "Senior Software Engineer" roles. Even if you feel like a "slow mid-level," 6 years is numerically Senior to most recruiters. Let *them*decide if you aren't qualified; don't reject yourself.
**Verdict:** The "junior" market is cooked; the "senior" market is hungry. You have the experience and the modern toolset. **Go for it**
