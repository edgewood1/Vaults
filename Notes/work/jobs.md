# jobs


Hi!  I'm looking for a remote frontend React/JS position.  Even though I've been working in software for 4-5 years, and have worked with a few different UI libraries, and know ReactJS, I actually haven't held a job in React, so the hiring manager would have to be comfortable with that.  Thanks.

team lead saying people are not taking enough lead

people reminding others - even though they don’t need reminders. 

people are more interested in promotional checklist 
rather than authenticallly helping
