# Lyrics


Born into giving it up

then closing down when it’s down
With hardly a moment to spent 
Before getting it back again

/// giving it up: cheering for another, to give in to sexual urges, a request for praise, and after that’s been given, one walks away, maybe ashamed, next line uses “give it up” in a different way - as in you’ve given an object to another, and then you take it back again quickly after. 

The longer you leave it
It’s harder to see it
Like i was going to show
It’s from something before I know

Whatever I said I might
Oh i take it back tonight
Where was the silence? 
It wasn’t in my hands
I tried just to feel it
Though i knew I believed it
