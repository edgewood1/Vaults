[Verse]
                  **E**                 **A**
Through all these Earthly trials of sorrow
                  **E**              **B7**
Through all these days of mortal sin
                  **E**                        **A**
Through all these eternal nights with no tomorrow
                  **E**                       **B7**                      **E**
Gotta stay on the straight and narrow and find a little light within
 
[Chorus]
N.C.            **E**                   **A**
Gotta walk that road all the way to Heaven
                **E**              **B7**
Gotta walk that road until the dawn
                **E**
Gotta walk that road all night
        **A**
All you need is a little light
        **E**                  **B7**                **E**
And the closer you get the brighter it turns on
 
[Solo]
**A**   **E**       **B7**  **E**
 
[Verse 2]
N.C.          **E**                 **A**
Don't need no compass no map or chart
              **E**              **B7**
Don't need no stars shining above
             **E**                    **A**
I don't need nothing but a little light in my heart
**E**                        **B7**         **E**
Glowing inside me like a blanket of love 
 
 
[Chorus]
                **E**                   **A**
Gotta walk that road all the way to Heaven
                **E**              **B7**
Gotta walk that road until the dawn
                **E**
Gotta walk that road all night
        **A**
All you need is a little light
        **E**                  **B7**                **E**
And the closer you get the brighter it turns on
           **E**                  **B7**                **E**
I said the closer you get the brighter it turns on.
