# Mando


0.012" strings and a heavy pick (I use a 3mm Jim Dunlop Stubby jazz guitar pick, or you can get thick, profiled picks made specifically for mandolin) will help. 

use a 1.5 mm plectrum. The importance of the plectrum is such that if you were to have a look on the mandolin website

place the plectrum on the first knuckle of your index finger and bring your thumb down on top to hold the pick in place. Your picking action then comes from your wrist

D’addarrio J74 are one of the most commonly used strings. not expensive and nothing wrong with them. J75 are thicker set, thye will slightly improve volume but they will be much harder for your daughter fret clean
