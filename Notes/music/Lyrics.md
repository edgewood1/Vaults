# Lyrics


Sunset falls upon my eyes
Blinds me to the summer sky
The night it darkens the way
Take my sleep among the leaves


Trudging on my way 
to that lake where
We had sat down to say
Trudging on my way 
Just to say it was the day 
And not the other thing
Could I please could I may

Pretty please
May I sweet
I’m sure I’ll find my
