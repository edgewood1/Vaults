2. Pedals
3. Amp
4. Speaker

Two kinds of amps
* digital/modeling/solid state: volume makes it louder, but tone doesn’t’ change. 
* Tube: as volume goes up, the power tubes get overwhelmed.  

Three stages of amplification

1. Gain/Drive controls input sensitivity. 
* Low: It can flow smoothly (clean sound, windfall) because it has a wide pipe.
* High: narrow the pipe, which forces much in. It becomes turbulent / distorted (drown). 
* Gain is not loudness, it is texture.  

1. Tone stack (EQ)
* Treble, mid, bass
* Lo mids / high bass/treble - modern/metal
* Boosted mids: vintage

1. Power Amp (muscle)
* Volume: controls output loudness

Pedals
* this is like middleware
* Tuner - needs raw signal to detect pitch.
* Overdrive: distort the signal
* Effects:
	* Modulation (tremolo)
	* Time (delay/reverb/looper)
	* Distort first, then add FX

The sound



1. The Setup:
• Amp (Stage 2): You set the amp to be just barely breaking up (Gain around 5-6). It sounds crunchy if you hit the strings hard, but clean if you play soft.
• Pedal (Stage 1): You add an Overdrive pedal (like the Nobels or Boss SD-1).
2. The Stack:
• You set the Pedal's Volume HIGH.
• You set the Pedal's Drive LOW.

Instead of the pedal adding fuzz, it sends a voltage spike to the amp, which pushes it over.  You get a natural compression and warmth of amp, but with the sustain of the pedal 

This is safer and more common for cover bands, but less "organic."
1. The Setup:
• Amp: Set to perfectly Clean (Gain 2-3). infinite headroom.
• Pedal: Set to Dirty (Drive 8-9).
2. The Result:
• The amp acts like a clear PA system. It just makes the pedal louder.
• You hear 100% of the pedal's tone, 0% of the amp's natural breakup.
