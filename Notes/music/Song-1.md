# Song


Clouds they race above the clouds
The world seems small
Walking down the highway
Aimless stroll
I’m always found 

There you are so many years ago
Still as close as a 

(Verse 1)
In a world of shadows, I roam alone,
Empty cities, streets of stone.
Through the darkness, I silently tread,
With the Perón watching, never misled.

(Chorus)
Desolate wandering, a lone soul's plight,
In the heart of the city, lost in the night.
They're always watching, their gaze profound,
In this desolation, nowhere to be found.

(Verse 2)
The neon lights flicker, but no one's around,
These empty streets, where silence resounds.
I search for solace, but it's hard to believe,
That I can escape what they perceive.

(Chorus)
Desolate wandering, a lone soul's plight,
In the heart of the city, lost in the night.
They're always watching, their gaze profound,
In this desolation, nowhere to be found.

(Bridge)
I've tried to escape this unyielding gaze,
But the Perón's presence, in every maze.
Invisible threads, they weave and they bind,
In this desolate city, I'm confined.

(Verse 3)
The city's a labyrinth, a place of despair,
With every step, I'm ensnared in their snare.
I yearn for freedom, to break from their hold,
But their watchful eyes, so relentless and bold.

(Chorus)
Desolate wandering, a lone soul's plight,
In the heart of the city, lost in the night.
They're always watching, their gaze profound,
In this desolation, nowhere to be found.

(Outro)
In this desolate world, I continue to roam,
With the Perón's knowledge, my secrets they own.
But I'll keep on searching, for a way to break free,
From this desolation, to find my destiny.
