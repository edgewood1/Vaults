Note to a Father

I’m sorry for your loss and the difficulties you must be experiencing during this time of transition.  

Fred was struck me as a resilient man, full of humor and surprises at every turn. 


I’m grateful that I was able to get to know him 
that he was able to see us get married. 
spend time with him during his last week 


I felt that we were able to establish a strong unspoken connection through 
which much was communicated; it will be a resource upon which I will draw all my life.

i’ll keep you both in my praters always

Love, 
Mel
