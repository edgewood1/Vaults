# Passover




Jewish people in Egypt were slaves. 
The Pharoah was the boss of the Egyptians.
God told Moses to free the Jews.
Moses told the pharaoh. 
Pharoah said no
God sent the plagues. 

They escaped the city
God opened the Read Sea
Jew ran through the opening and escaped.
The Sea closed up.
They celebrated Passover.
