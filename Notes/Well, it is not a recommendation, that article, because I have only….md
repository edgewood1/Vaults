Well, it is not a recommendation, that article, because I have only read the first two pages.  

For me, the radiant generality expressed by the title led to a frustrated need to spend time within the ambitions and references of the author, rather than being blocked by a paywall. It seemed like something that would interest you, too. 

I was somewhat heartened to see that someone is (perhaps, I'm really not yet sure) approaching the possibility of Geo-spatial belief and spiritual practices which are not antique and which do acknowledge the reality of the Anthropocene. I also found a long animation cycle/storytelling thing by Sczszynsky. (You should see him! He looks like an ET.) He seems to be the only planetary vitalist who is putting forward the idea that the Anthropocene, like all other Earth ages, is an expression of the energy and needs of the planet. Rather than being acted upon brutally, the Earth has produced the Anthropocene, and has its reasons for doing so. At least I see this suggested in what I've seen so far. 

This would be in contrast to Paul Kingsnorth's ideas about what is happening and how to shape it for the well-being of the planet. 

I have not read Deleuze, so I am hoping to patch through this article without that background. I found 1000 plateaus completely incoherent when I attempted to read it. Despite the rhizome concept, which I liked, it seemed like over 600 pages of lifeless prose. (That may just mean that I don't enjoy abstraction as much as you do.) Some do not categorize him as a materialist though he was more or less a Marxist. He's 'accused' (by Marxists, I believe) of being an Idealist and a Metaphysician. As if that is damning! 

That article came up because I wondered what I could find about geographical/temporal prayer traditions, and I was interested partly because of my friend Beanie's Earthing practice. She sees this standing barefoot on the ground thing she does as essential to her health and has theories about the way it works that sounds kind of pseudoscientific to me. I decided to try doing this, all the same--not really as recommended, but I go out in the morning for just a few moments, and face East without any mental catechism or anything of that nature. 

I long ago observed that Islam is uniquely time/space oriented among world faiths. In one of the photos of hospital staff in Khan Kounis you can see that they are in standing prayer, facing Mecca, many of them in uniforms stained with blood. Even in that situation they would, at a certain time, turn a certain direction together and pray. 

Shinto, at least as I understand it, is a religion of place and of natural processes, which are themselves divine. I'm not sure this is even 'animism' because it's not as though a transcendent being is attached to these things. Their divine nature is in simply being what they are.

When I was more interested in Western Magical traditions I of course encountered directional invocation, the association of particular angelic names with the cardinal directions, and there were astrological requirements for certain actions, so that involved time--secondarily.

The cathedrals of the old world were oriented--I can't remember how exactly! I think the Sanctuary was always in the North. I was interested to read that the courses of holy processions in Rome formed specific patterns within the map of the city. I have some kind of intuitive fondness to the idea of liturgical cycle, but not particularly as it is found in Catholicism.

So I was really interested in all of that when that article came up and I am reading it now.


I managed to stay offline today except for this email. Israel seems to be succeeding in drawing the US into a regional conflict that will include warfare throughout the 'Historical Israel' they are religiously attached to--that includes Lebanon, Jordan, half of Syria, and a chunk of Egypt. The government has, so far, done exactly what they said they would do, from the beginning. People aired videos of leaders saying that there would be nothing left of Gaza back in Oct. and many were outraged on the basis of this 'rhetoric.' But it was not rhetoric, it was a plan. Since then they have described their intention to remove their enemies beyond their border in other sovereign nations including Lebanon, and I see no reason to believe that is just rhetoric either.
