# Teaching’


Has to do more with observing processes than imposing forms.   We learn to observe by observing our own process as we maintain artistic threads.  We learn to see our own forms morph over time and thus get to know the life cycles of forms such that we develop an intuition for them, that if one form unfolds than its likely going to move in a certain direction and if its not, it likely needs a degree of influence that nevertheless respects the free will of the unfolding itself.  

This is the reason we maintain artistic threads, that we maintain non-productive (non-product-oriented) practices, so that we learn  morphology - the study of the lifecycle of forms.
