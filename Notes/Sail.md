The writings of Religion creates the analogy between our relationship with others and that with god.  Dogma, such as those arising from the doctrine of the trinity, is an attempt to define this relationship. Much like   The laws of nature attempt to define forces of nature.  God ir infinity is the ideal transcendent in all regards both physically and cognitively whereas the human also contains a transcendence   U fortunately people attempt to towline others including god. Regularly.   As you say god exceeds the idea that you have of it.   God as being itself can’t be an existent.  So maybe yr discomfort with references to god are related to thoughts about god rather than god itself   People abuse religion in totalizing it and god which is the subject of religion but this is no reason for the rejection of god.
