# You move yourself and are moved


Me too

But what gave us the ability to do this?  Surely not ourselves.  So it must be something outside ourselves.  Like the physical processes of the world  and the metaphysical.  But what brought these about surely not themselves. So it’s an outside thing.   This chain would regress infinitely unless there were something that was the source of its own movement.  

If the subsequent cause in a series didn’t exist then nor would its effects.      If there were no first cause then there wouldn’t be a second. So there must be a first cause which means this cause would be unmoved mover. 

This also implies two kinds of causal series.  The one for contingent effects and the one for no. Contingent effects.  The first. If you remove the first the second ceases.  This must be the kind he’s referí g to.
