I have two questions: 

what’s the difference between + and , in console.log? 

    console.log("Request recieved on path " + trimmedPath + " with this method " + method + " with these query strings parameters " , queryStringObject);

curl localhost:3000/foo/bar?fiz=buz

+ vs , in console.log for querystring

   var trimmedPath = path.replace(/^\/+|\/+$/g,'');


The g above. 


****

get has no payload and query strings

post has a payload and no query strings

2 3/8 in trapway
4” piston action accelerator flush valve



2 1/8 fushing system

3 in flush valve for powerful flush - cade 3

hyper casual games

ENTERING _ The larger the flush valve, the higher the rate of water flow


**exit - rapway:** The snakelike tubing on the sides of your toilet through which water flows. A larger trapway diameter (ex. 2 3/8-in) reduces the chance of clogging and overflow.

**water efficiency**

gerber - 3 “ flush valve 2” trapway 1.6 gpf - height: 14 7/8 - 
champion - 4” flush valve, 2 3/8 trapway - 1.28 gpf - height: 16 1/2 (tall)
cadet 3 elongated - 3’ valve 2 1/8 trap 1.28 gpf  - height: 15”. $200 - arrives 9/5-9/10


**standard 2 1/8 with 3’ flush valve**

**1/4” bigger - 25% bigger -** 

**why this toilet?  is it the price? stock
when needed buy**

Good question. You'll want to use querystring.stringify() when you're trying to create a string full of keys and values (like you would see in a URL). You'll want to use JSON.stringify() when you're trying to create JSON.
Generally speaking, you'll be using querystring.stringify() to help make your query strings (such as for GET requests), and JSON.stringify() to make your payloads (such as for POST requests).

Here's more info about querystring.stringify() from the docs:

<u>[https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options)</u>

To reuse the example they give. If you have this object:


{ foo: 'bar', baz: ['qux', 'quux'], corge: '' }

Then using querystring.stringify() will yield this: (A query string)


'foo=bar&baz=qux&baz=quux&corge='

Whereas JSON.stringify would have yielded this: (JSON)


'{"foo":"bar","baz":["qux","quux"],"corge":""}'


Due to advances in hydraulic designs, these 1.6 gpf toilets work as well, and in some cases even better than older toilets in terms of bulk removal and reducing clogs.
