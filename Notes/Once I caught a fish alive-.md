# Once I caught a fish alive.

Once I caught a fish alive.

One, two, three, four, five.
Once I caught a fish alive.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Then I let it go again.
Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on the right.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Once I caught a fish alive.

Then I let it go again.

[A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-B-C
When you sing you begin with Do-Re-Mi](https://genius.com/12161228/Julie-andrews-do-re-mi/A-very-good-place-to-start-when-you-read-you-begin-with-a-b-c-when-you-sing-you-begin-with-do-re-mi)

(spoken)
Oh, let's see if I can make it easier

(sung)
[Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a drop of golden sun
Mi, a name I call myself
Fa, a long, long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Ti, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do, oh, oh, oh](https://genius.com/16039214/Julie-andrews-do-re-mi/Do-a-deer-a-female-deer-re-a-drop-of-golden-sun-mi-a-name-i-call-myself-fa-a-long-long-way-to-run-so-a-needle-pulling-thread-la-a-note-to-follow-so-ti-a-drink-with-jam-and-bread-that-will-bring-us-back-to-do-oh-oh-oh)

[MARIA, spoken]
Now children, Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-and-so on are natur'ly the tunes we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your head
You can sing a million diff'rent tune by mixin' them up
Like this:

(sung)
So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re

(spoken)
Can you do that?

[CHILDREN, sung]
So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re

[MARIA]
So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

[CHILDREN]
So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

[MARIA, spoken]
Now let's put it all together

[MARIA & CHILDREN, sung]
So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re
So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

[MARIA, spoken]
Good!

[BRIGITTA, spoken]
But it doesn't mean anything

[MARIA, spoken]
So we put in words—one word for ev'ry note, like this:

(sung)
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

[MARIA & CHILDREN:]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
