Form - organizing principle - all entities alive or not have a form that determines what it is, even if that form isn’t a soul. 

A nonliving thing is part of a cosmic order, that means it participates, and participation implies a degree of intelligence. 

Form implies that everything has some kind of organizing principle that could be analogized to soul.  It is basic mind or awarenesss.  

Every monad has a degree of perception or soul-like activity - if only internal life.  

General form distinguishes a human from animal and others, like inanimate form.  

A soul is a general form that is individualized.  It has additional degree of organization and identity.  The shared nature is the rational soul, it is immediately individualized.  there are not two terms for these degrees of soul.  They are not thought of as different things.   We have one rational soul that is particularized in each person.  Forms have a duality in their nature - they have shared nature and unique one.  If form is the essence of a thing,  allowing many to share that form.   Much like we all have cells.  When a form is instantiated in a particular piece of matter, it is individualized.  A unique person is general soul and body.  The general expresses itself uniquely once in contact with matter.  In a sense, the general is born into a specific?  A form can be both universal and individual at once.  The form itself doesn’t morph.
