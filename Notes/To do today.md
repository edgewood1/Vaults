# To do today


## **Quickest Method (macOS)**
Apple Notes recently added a native markdown exporter that makes this transition significantly faster: 
1. **Select Notes:** Open Apple Notes on your Mac, click a folder, and press ⌘A to select all notes.
5. **Export:** Go to **File > Export as... > Markdown** and save them into a new folder on your desktop.
9. **Import to Bear:** Open Bear and go to **File > Import From > Markdown Folder**. Select your desktop folder to bring them in. 

## **Why this is "Safe":**
* **Non-Destructive:** This process creates an external copy of your data. Your original notes remain exactly where they were in Apple Notes.
* **Metadata Retention:** Bear’s importer includes an option to **"Keep original dates"**, ensuring your notes don't all look like they were created today. 

## **Important Limitations:**
* **Attachments:** Native markdown export may exclude some non-photo attachments like PDFs. These will stay safely in Apple Notes but won't move to Bear automatically.
* **Formatting:** Check the <u>[Bear Migration Guide](https://bear.app/faq/migrate-from-apple-notes/)</u> if you have complex checklists or drawings, as these may convert to plain text or bulleted lists. 
If you are on **iOS only**, the process is slower because you must use the **Share Sheet** to send notes to Bear one by one, or use a third-party Exporter app from the Mac App Store to handle bulk transfers more cleanly. 
Do you have a **large number of attachments** or **Apple Pencil sketches** that need to move over?

These guides detail options for migrating Apple Notes to Bear, including the official markdown export and third-party tools
