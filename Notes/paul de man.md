I think that Spivak was an agent of British Intelligence. I think her mentor DeMan was almost certainly a spy, placed inside the US academic system, ultimately monitoring the recruitment patterns of the CIA at Yale, probably for the Gehlen organization. (They got rid of him when he started playing different groups against each other to get more money. See the recent biography of him, which paints a clear picture of a sociopath and con artist, and felon.) I think Derrida himself was someone's little Free Masonic project, and that by signing onto this (perhaps while his judgment was distorted by amphetamine abuse, at the Ecole Normale, (via the operative Althusser?)) he essentially ruined his talent (which he did have). I think Spivak was recruited by de Man to do the translation of the "ponderous and ineffective" (Edward Said's characterization) Of Grammatology -- where D's limited but in some ways potentially insightful views of Husserl are blown up as though by a tire pump into the grandiose pretentious and execrably written pseudo-philosophical extravaganza specifically designed by these same Free Masonic groups to see how much double talk the supposed intelligentsia of the US could be induced to swallow. (Spivak was strictly unqualified for the job -- she was not a philosopher, and a native speaker of neither language -- did she even have previous translation experience?; but they needed someone to do it, and it was then artificially promoted through all the university book stores of the US, (as she herself was in their Comp Lit departments, as payment.)  The role of artificial signs in guiding and inciting both "perception" and "cognition" (both poorly defined ideas) is  D's essential subject, but his analysis is hampered by his own erroneous assumptions (H is engaged in a "monologue" and this can be shown to be essentially impossible), and by his misuse of Saussure.﻿
