# It’s a blue and Orange hued sky

# 
It’s a blue and Orange hued sky
That gives you the reasons for where and why
It’s you leaning Into the bone-tired arms
That makes me forget about the initial harm 


Chorus
And oh. It’s a long long way that I fly
When I close my eyes 
And see the dream come to me
And see your pictures fall to me

Chainlinled fences tend the spaces
Keeps us safe from the long highway
Thru the chain links I can see you 
And all the rest of the comings

And oh oh which is harder now
The coming or going of your gentle arms
I see the dream  come to me when I close my eyes I see the pictures sail down to me
