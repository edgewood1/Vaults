# Her

When we get play three atttifes arrise references by the phrases touch don’t touch. Jumó towards and draw back. Lately a third. Careful.  A table a wall - be careful.  When she practices care she holds her hands up as if holding the object in balanced perspective. Or as if invisibly balancing.  Her gaze is softer neither acquisitive or distancing.  But rather a wonder of what lays between. This thing on the verge of falling apart and yet somehow holding itself together without hint of its being on the verge.  In the past my life was always this care. Until care slipped away and this play or touch and don’t touch rise to the fore again. Don’t touch this bc it will prevent you from achieving y bc u must always chisels away at y. Or must I?  How to bring in care if not thru qeiting this.  A care spell cast on who ever might read and respell.
