I was surprised to learn how much they were insistent upon: a payment of between 150-600.  But, yes, they gladly took a 10 spot and two cold seltzer waters.  

I can easily imagine someone as vulnerable in their own way handing over much more.  

 
I was surprised to learn how large a payment they were insistent upon: between 150-600. But, yes, they gladly took a 10 spot and two cold seltzer waters. I can easily imagine someone equally vulnerable, or perhaps even more so, handing over much more.

Absolutely! Here are a couple of ways to restate your final paragraph, keeping your core message with slight variations in emphasis:

Original: 

>They certainly didn't seem happy or suited for the work.  I was surprised to learn how large a payment they were insistent upon: between 150-600. But, yes, they gladly took a 10 spot and two cold seltzer waters. I can easily imagine someone equally vulnerable, or perhaps even more so, handing over much more. 

Option 1: Emphasizing Contrast & Vulnerability

> They certainly didn't seem happy or suited for the work. Yet, the steep payment they demanded – between 150-600 – was shocking.  They gratefully accepted the small amount I offered. It breaks my heart to think someone just as vulnerable, or even more so, might give them everything they have.

Option 2:  Focusing on Exploitation & Empathy

> They certainly didn't seem happy or suited for the work.   It's horrifying to realize that someone in their position might be forced to ask for such large sums of money. They gratefully accepted the small amount I offered, but it makes me wonder about the desperate circumstances they're facing.  It's heartbreaking to think how easily people can be exploited when vulnerable. 

Additional Notes:

* Choose the version that best aligns with the overall tone of your writing.
* Consider slightly tweaking words (e.g., "forced" to "pressured") based on how explicit you want to be about exploitation.
