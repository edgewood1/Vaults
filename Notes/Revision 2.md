# Revision 2


1. Scale of nature exists on a spectrum
2. The human appears superior to the mineral due to its apparent complexity of abilities.-—
3. However, consider the scale of meta-nature: the hierarchy of nature.
4. The most powerful beings on this scale are closest to god, and yet they only seem to have one simple function: to sing his praises. 
5. Lower beings on this scale cannot experience god directly - their closest experience is of these higher more power angels singing his praises - so here, we have the beginnings of a potential choice: should they also praise god. 
6. With increased distance, there grows increased potential and increased doubt. 
7. For those furthest away, praising is a matter of faith - of choice, of assent that there is absolute goodness in the world and that one can cling to it, build a foundation on it.
8. In a sense, faith becomes a mode of perception - the ability to see, if only in an imaginative or metaphorical way, the reality of god.
9. We could use this analogy with the scale of nature.
10. Mineral world is faithful and what they contribute is the superstructure of this foundation.  They mimic absolutely, which is a creative project.  
11. But life brings mobility into this mineral composition - the beginnings of something other. A mobile reflection of stasis. 
12. With increased mobility there grows a realization of the sensual nature of the real as well as its potential symbolic nature - which is a realm of potential flux.  

**What is an idea?**

Objects are independent entities, and ideas are objects that appear in the mind.  

These objects represent other actual or potential objects, concepts, or experiences in the world.  In this sense, they function as symbols, mediating our understanding and shaping our interactions with reality. 

Ideas are evolving constructs that are influenced by language, culture, and individual experiences.

They are often considered passive entities that require an agent to act upon them.

However, some ideas can exert a strong force, consuming our attention and even debilitating us.   

**Where does the force behind an idea come from?** 

1. Some ideas might have inherent qualities that make them more compelling or captivating. For example, ideas that tap into our deepest fears, desires, or values can exert a strong pull on our attention and emotions.

1. However, we have some control over whether we should engage with an idea in a balanced way or in an unbalanced way, wholly consumed and dominated by the idea.  We can also can also dismiss or challenge many idea or to redirect our attention elsewhere.   
**Symbolic** 

However, an idea might be more than merely an isolated object.  It could be described as part of a larger whole, called the symbolic order.  

This order is the network of language and social norms that shapes how we experience and communicate about the world.  The symbolic order is on par with our shared language and concepts.  
It (is the script that) tells us the basic meaning of things. 

For example, it’s due to the symbolic order the a group of people can come to a shared understanding of what the word “freedom” means. 

**Ideology**

The symbolic order is energized by competing ideologies.  

Ideology operates within the symbolic order, giving its terms specific meanings and values, telling us how we should understand / interpret these things, shaping our perceptions, beliefs, actions, desires, beliefs, and even our unconscious.

Ideology energizes the symbolic, passing force and agency to any of its specific ideas. 

For example, while the symbolic order allows us to agree that a dog is a dog, ideology dictates whether we see it as a beloved pet or a working animal

**Characteristics of Ideology**

Ideology is pervasive - we are always immersed in it; we can’t simply opt out of it.

It operates unconsciously, making  it difficult to resist the influence of certain ideas, even if we consciously try to do so.  This gives it a kind of agency over our subjectivity, influencing how we perceive and interact with the world.

It creates the illusion that someone else truly believes in it. This can make us more susceptible to its influence, even if we maintain a cynical distance.

It operates materially, shaping our actions and by extension our institutions.  

**Material force (stop)**

When we say it operates materially, we mean it is primarily experienced and embodied in our daily actions and unconscious habits, which give rise to the concrete objects, institutions, and social structures that surround us.  

These creations of man represent past actions and embody the values and beliefs of past and present ideologies.

Consider the ideology of individualism reflected in our competitive work culture, our emphasis on personal achievement, and even the design of our cities, which prioritize individual transportation over public spaces. 

Similarly, consumerism encourages us to define ourselves through material possessions, leading to practices like excessive shopping and the constant pursuit of the newest products.

Ideology also influences our understanding and interaction within specific spheres of life. For example, gender ideology shapes our behaviors and expectations based on perceived gender roles, manifesting in the clothes we wear, the careers we pursue, and how we interact with others. 

In education, dominant ideologies are embedded in the curriculum, teaching methods, and architecture, often promoting conformity and competition.

Even our interaction with nature reflects ideological forces. While nature itself exists outside human constructs, our impact on it – from conservation efforts to resource exploitation – is shaped by our ideological systems.

Ultimately, ideology provides a framework for defining the terms and values within any given sphere, influencing how we socialize and interact with the world around us.

(What about nature - here we see our effects, but the presence of nature is the result of something larger - the ideological and symbolic systems of higher beings.  

**Freedom / Questioning**

While freedom implies the ability to act according to one's will, ideology shapes how that freedom is interpreted and practiced within society. 

That said, it seems that the true definition of freedom simply means the questioning of our current ideology.  

The irony of questioning our current ideology is that in doing so, we slip into another.  We may believe we are breaking free, but we are simply shifting our allegiance to a different set of beliefs. 

If we are familiar with a sufficient number of ideologies, the value of such questioning is that such questioning gives us choice - the ability to choose the framework through which we view the world, acknowledging that each circumstance may require different perspectives. 

This questioning also raises helps us better see the the ideological forces shaping our thinking.  It helps us create a critical distance and open possibilities for resistance. It allows us to identify inconsistencies, challenge assumptions, and imagine alternatives

**Subject as partial effect (stop)**

Our subjectivity—our sense of self and desires—is an effect of ideology, shaped by the symbolic order. But ideologies are never perfectly coherent; they contain internal contradictions and gaps. Dreams, anxieties, and slips of the tongue can be seen as symptoms of the "real" erupting through the symbolic. Additionally, the illusion of others' belief in an ideology creates a cyclical distance, which can become a source of critique.

Also, ideology functions by creating the illusion that someone else believes in it, creating a cyclical distance from ideology even while being the subject to its influence.  This distance can be a source of critique. 

By recognizing the gap between official ideology and its actual practice, we can question its legitimacy and expose contradictions. Artistic creation and acts of protest can be seen as attempts to break with the symbolic and create new possibilities. Our agency, then, is a complex negotiation between our conscious intentions, unconscious desires, and the constraints of the symbolic order. Our actions become attempts to grapple with the "real" and navigate the gap between the symbolic and the real.

**The real** 

Both Žižek and Harman grapple with the concept of the "real," but their approaches differ significantly. For Žižek, the real is traumatic and unrepresentable, a gap or inconsistency within the symbolic order that resists symbolization. It is the source of anxiety, constantly threatening to disrupt our understanding and expose the limitations of language. Think of the raw experience of pain or intense desire—experiences that defy easy categorization. Ideology, in Žižek's view, attempts to pave over these gaps.
Harman, on the other hand, sees real objects as withdrawn essences, independent entities that never fully disclose themselves, even through the symbolic. These objects possess a hidden depth, and we only ever encounter their sensual qualities— "translations" or "caricatures" of their true essence. While the symbolic is one way we interact with these objects, Harman's real is not limited to the symbolic realm; it withdraws from all access.
Essentially, Žižek's real is a void within the symbolic, a source of disruption and anxiety, while Harman's real is an independent entity, a source of hidden depth and inexhaustible meaning. Both concepts challenge our understanding of reality and highlight the limitations of human knowledge, but they do so from different perspectives

**Form and ideology**

Drawing from both Harman and Aquinas, we can conceive of form as a quality of the real object that contributes to its sensual qualities. If we consider ideology as an object in this framework, its sensual qualities become the social reality we inhabit. This social reality, in turn, possesses a form arising from the ideology's real essence—its withdrawn essence, the underlying structure and logic shaping its manifestations.

Forms, in this view, possess varying degrees of agency. Many ideologies exhibit a high degree of agency, functioning akin to a virus. Their form becomes an active force, shaping and organizing reality according to its inherent logic. This perspective allows us to understand how ideologies can exert such a powerful influence on our lives, shaping not only our beliefs and values but also the very fabric of our social world

Viral expansions

This notion of ideology as possessing a viral agency resonates with the work of thinkers like William S. Burroughs and Gilles Deleuze. Burroughs, particularly in *Naked Lunch*, portrays language itself as a virus, a parasitic force that infects and controls individuals, dictating their perceptions and actions. 

Similarly, Deleuze and Guattari, in *A Thousand Plateaus*, introduce the concept of the "meme" – self-replicating units of cultural information that spread through imitation and repetition, shaping social and cultural evolution.

However, while Burroughs often portrays the virus negatively, as a controlling force that limits individual freedom, Deleuze and Guattari see potential for liberation in the viral spread of ideas. They envision a rhizomatic network of interconnected ideas, constantly evolving and mutating, capable of challenging dominant power structures.

In the context of ideology as a virus, we can see both aspects at play. Ideologies can be insidious, infecting our minds and shaping our desires without our conscious awareness, perpetuating harmful social norms and oppressive systems. Conversely, they can also be forces for positive change, spreading new ideas and inspiring social movements.

Thinking of ideology as a virus helps us understand its agency, its ability to spread and replicate, and its potential for both control and liberation. It reminds us to be critical of the ideas we encounter, to question their origins and their effects, and to actively participate in shaping the ideological landscape that surrounds us.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, our agency doesn't simply confront passive ideas; it navigates the complex and dynamic field of ideology. Ideas gain force and influence through their position within the symbolic order, a structure shaped and maintained by ideology itself. This understanding, drawing from diverse thinkers like Žižek, Harman, Aquinas, Burroughs, and Deleuze, highlights the pervasive and often unconscious influence of ideology on our lives. It encourages us to critically examine the ideologies that shape our world, recognizing their subtle yet powerful effects on our thoughts, desires, and actions. By understanding the viral nature of ideologies, their potential for both control and liberation, we can become more conscious participants in the ongoing process of shaping our social reality.
