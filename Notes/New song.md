# New song



Write your letter
Convey the rhythms of this place
Words elude me
It leaves where I feared id be

Make a phone call
Rehearse the sentimental sound
Hear your voice then
It leaves where I feared id be

Blow it up
Time to leave
From a distance it’ll form
What’s this distance your all right here 
Let it take on no form at all
We might find another way

The old MG
This machine
