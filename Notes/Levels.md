# Levels


Absolutely! Here's an expanded model that aims to include additional faculties while remaining streamlined:
Level 1: Embodied Perception and Action
* External Senses: Gathering raw sensory data (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste)
* Internal Senses: Basic processing of sensory data, forming initial perceptions (imagination, common sense, memory)
* Motor Systems: Control of movement and physical interaction with the environment.
* Instincts and Appetites: Basic drives, motivations, and immediate bodily responses (hunger, thirst, fear, fight-or-flight, etc.)
Level 2:  Emotional and Social Evaluation
* Estimative Power: Judging the relevance of stimuli in terms of safety, potential benefit, or harm.
* Emotions and Passions: Complex feelings and affective responses that influence judgments and actions (joy, sadness, anger, love, etc.)
* Social Cognition: Understanding social dynamics, intentions of others, cultural norms, and forming relationships.
Level 3: Abstract Reasoning and Self-Awareness
* Intellect (Active and Passive): Formation of abstract concepts, logical reasoning, and understanding of universal principles.
* Will: The power to choose, direct attention, and consciously regulate behavior based on reason and goals.
* Metacognition: Awareness of one's own thoughts, emotions, and mental processes.
Key Features of This Model:
* Embodied Foundation: Recognizes the crucial role of the body and its interactions with the world in shaping our mental life.
* Emotional Integration: Emotions aren't merely side effects but influence how we perceive, evaluate, and act in the world.
* Complexity and Interaction: Acknowledges that these levels are interconnected. Abstract reasoning can guide emotions, and vice versa.
Important Notes:
* Flexibility: The exact placement of some faculties might be debatable due to their multifaceted nature.
* Modern Influence: This model borrows insights from modern cognitive science and psychology to supplement Aquinas's framework.
