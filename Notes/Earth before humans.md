# Earth before humans


1. Humans have always been part of earth, not necesssarily as concrete objects, but virtual or dormant objects. 
2. The unfolding of evolution is the unfolding of humanity.  The earth is the shedding away of aspects of the human in its desire to sculpt the human.  The aspects shed retain the same intelligent substance that shapes the human, and thus there is a correlation.  Mountain ranges harken to the skeletal system.  Currents to the circulatory system.  Fire harkens to the warmth.  Initially the human was a heat core.  With cooling, the human became a system of currents and flows  - initially airy then more substantial - watery.
3. Is it the human that is shaping this? The gods? A god? 
4. Can we divide the human vs nature? 
5. OOO describes a world where communication is not restricted to living creatures.  Water and solids are continuously interacting, never capable of achieving complete knowledge of the other, like us, and this is partially what fuels their existence. 
6. That these things even exist implies god.
