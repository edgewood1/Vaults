can i access the backedup files from any device? and can i make changes to the backedup files from such a device? and if i'm backing up a mac, but later switch to a synology NAS, is it easy to have my service switch to this machine? thanks.

Hello There,
Let me answer your questions
Yes, you can issue restore requests for the files backed up by the Backblaze Personal Backup Plan through any browser
Since the backup is a live mirror of the files on the computer you installed Backblaze on, the backup cannot be "edited"
it's a backup system, not online storage
If you're interested in online storage we do have that as a separate service, B@
B2
NAS devices cannot be backed up by the Personal Backup Plan. If you want to backup a Synology NAS, you can do so with our B2 cloud storage which is integrated with Synology.
You can read more about it in this help article: <u>[https://www.backblaze.com/b2/partner-synology.html](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/partner-synology.html)</u>

i see.  can we use B2 for a mac as well? also, can i infer that B2 allows for the editing of stored files?
Bob
Yes, and yes
We recommend using other programs that are integrated with B2 to run backups on Macs. You can view the full list here: <u>[https://www.backblaze.com/b2/integrations.html](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/integrations.html)</u>
For backups in particular, we recommend Cloudberry You can read more about it in this help article: <u>[https://www.backblaze.com/b2/partner-cloudberry.html](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/partner-cloudberry.html)</u>

thanks.  i'll check out these articles.  i have an old mac that i was thinking of using as my server, but am also considering replacing the mac with a synology nas.  would it be wise to get b2 for the mac, and later when i get the NAS, just have b2 target the NAS instead of the mac? would that be easy? or is it best to get the nas now?  
Bob
Yes, yes and up to you

ok, last question - what does b2 cost per TB? is 1 TB approx $100/year? just want to make sure i was reading that table right.
Bob
The storage cost is $5 per TB per month
