Christmas
Father 
Spirit
Stellar entities
Chtohnic entities
Material props - amplifiers
People’s moods
Because of the cold? 
It’s more
Is it ideology? But what is ideology?
Idea is a signifier for essences, that’s re real spirit objects


A prayer of protection to say
On its own 
With meal


Why Catholicism

Literature: 
Nature studies: nature and grace are not distinct entities


The analogy
The landscapes of the earth.
The vastness of its underground and atmosphere is one  thing
The vastness of its surrounding universe is another. 
So vast it can only be represented by a map of our solar system
A circle. 

The same can be said of the upper and underground

Our physical world is as vast as the landscapes of the earth


The spiritual worlds are as vast as the universe, and we only experience glimmers.

And then there’s the outside: the macro verse.  

And beyond that there is the all-consuming all-unfolding god. The source. 

Essay: 

Movie Task the kid getting sentenced for killing someone. 
It’s all his fault. 
But is it? What happened as a kid? Etc
