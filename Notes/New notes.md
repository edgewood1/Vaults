# New notes


The real gives rise to the form, or organizing principle, of the sensual aspect.   This encompasses the tree’s potential for growth, it’s resposniveness, its unique way of being a tree. The principle of acutality that defines the tree.  
The sensual aspect of this form might be how we encounter the form itself - as a specific shape and organization and pattern of branch, leaf, bark.  
Likewise the tree’s matter has a real aspect - the raw potentiality that allows it to take on form - the inherent capacity of the stuff to be shaped - the underlying capacity for becoming. 
We experience this matter as the texture of the bark, the weight of the wood, the scent of the leaves.  It’s the tangible expression of the tree’s matter, the way its materiality intersects with our sense - material or intellectual.  


While form and matter are under the auspices of the tree’s reality, they possess their own respective real objects with their own hidden depths.
The sensual arises from the real, and the sensual consists of form and matter, each of which are also objects with their own real and sensual aspects. 
1. Reality of a tree is the tree itself, and what we see-tree is its sensuality.
2. The what-we-see-tree has a form + matter.
3. the reality of form is pure act? 
4. the reality of matter is matter itself
5. Does form matter has its own se
6. The 
* the reality of matter is pure potentiality? 
* The reality of form is pure actuality? 
* But what about this particular form, deferring to the reality of the tree? 
* And while some matter can defer to the reality of the tree - is it temporary? 
But does each have its own sensuality? The sensuality of the form is the sensual object of the tree? Would they coincide? 
And what of matter?
Matter extends beyond the real-sensuality of the tree. It is associated with the tree’s exterior. 
Matter, while potentially shapeless, has its own unique essence and qualities. It's not merely passive; it interacts with form to produce the sensual object we encounter.
**Embedded objects**
It sounds like the objects of matter and form are embedded or nested structures within that of the tree.  
The source of these two objects is the tree’s reality. 
These two objects contribute to the sensual object we perceive. 
This form is not simply a physical shape, but encompasses the object's potentialities and capacity for change.
Matter is external
One way to understand this relationship is to consider matter as external to the real object, while form is internal. 
It is also an shared resource - the real object draws upon it.  However, form is more intimately tied to the object's withdrawn essence. 
Both matter and form are real objects with their own hidden depths, engaging in a dynamic interplay. 
If matter is purely potential, how can it also be a real object with its own hidden depth?
Even though matter has the potential to be shaped, it still possesses its own unique essence and qualities that contribute to its interactions with other objects. This essence is withdrawn, but it's not simply reducible to potentiality.
So form is more closely tied to a thing’s real object while matter is not - matter is external tot he thing’s real object.  
**Embeddedness**
This creates a nested structure of objects within objects, where the real object of the tree gives rise to the form and matter objects, which in turn contribute to the sensual object that we experience as the tree.
form tied to real; matter not.  Although matter is written on the surface o the real object in the sense that form implies matter (in created creatures)
 Thus it would seem the real object of the tree gives rise to two other objects which help to shape or translate the sensual object that is the tree.  
However, this matter that arises from the tree’s real object is the same matter that arises from all real objects, thus, does it really arise from the real object of the tree?  
Also, does this same arrangement exist for form? Is the form object that arises from the tree’s real object the same form object that arises from all real objects or is this form object unque to the tree’s real object? 
Maybe the material object is outside the tree’s real object and is merely utilized by the tree unlike the tree’s form object?
**The Puzzle of Matter:**
matter is a fundamental, shared aspect of reality that all real objects "draw upon" in their manifestation. The tree's real object doesn't create matter but rather utilizes it in its expression.
while matter is fundamentally the same across all objects, it undergoes a process of differentiation as it interacts with specific real objects. The matter that constitutes the tree is still matter, but it's been shaped and influenced by the tree's real essence.
**The Question of Form:**
While talking about form in terms of  a thing’s “shape”, form is much more.  It encompasses its unique character, potentialities, and its capacity for change. It, along with the object's environment, shapes its interactions and transformations, revealing a dynamic interplay between the tangible and intangible aspects of reality
**Repeat:** Is the form object that arises from the tree's real object unique to the tree, or is it the same form object that arises from all real objects?
Form is unique to the tree.  But it is a quality that contributes to its sensual qualities rather than some ultimately defining essence. 
the material object might be external to the tree's real object while the form object is internal is an interesting one. It aligns with the idea that matter is a more fundamental, shared aspect of reality, while form is more closely tied to the individual essence of the object.
**Key Takeaways:**
* Nested: the real object gives rise to both matter and form objects, which in turn contribute to the sensual object.
* The form object is likely unique to each real object, reflecting its individual essence and contributing to its unique sensual qualities.
* The idea of matter being external and form being internal to the real object offers a potential way to understand their different roles in shaping the sensual object.
**Form is more than “shape”**
By form, we mean something more than the physical shape of things.  
We mean the non-physical agent responsible for an object’s shape and abilities.  The fact that an object can experience change is the result of its form and its environment.
**Form integrated into objects**
Aquinas on the other hand, describes an object as a matter that is given shapes by form, which is the principle of actualization.  Form is not seperate from matter, but rather an inherent principle that in-forms it, and is organized into a hierarchy of forms. If we integrate this concept we could talk about form as a quality of the real object, contributing to its sensual qualities, shaping how the real object is translated into the sensual object.  It mediates between the two. 
**Form vs real object.** 
Aquinas's form is inherent in matter, while Harman emphasizes the withdrawal of real objects. This tension needs to be addressed.
**Form cannot be the real object because form  is accessible while real object is not.** The real object is largely withdrawn, yet can affect  the sensual qualities we experience. 
Since our experience of these sensual qualities can trigger physical responses in our bodies, this suggests that experience itself has both physical and non-physical dimensions
