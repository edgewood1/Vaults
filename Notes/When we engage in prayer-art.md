# When we engage in prayer/art

# 


* isn’t it always transactional in the sense that it encourages us to have an encounter, experience that can change us?  As tomberg says, we sacrifice and recieve a blessing. 
* Prayer for another, showing gratitude, or working out questions through art, this sort of giving over, this subtle non-direct approach… maybe the key is subtle and non-directness rather than strictly non-transactional? The sort of receptivity that enables mutual change - if i change, it’s likely that the other expereincign me will change - maybe it’s this element that is more vital rather than the push and pull that implies non-receptivity.
