That metaphysical conviction lay behind Goethe=s aphorism that “an unknown, law-like something in the object corresponds to an unknown, law-like something in the subject.”19 

In this Kantian light, Goethe urged in his essay that the anatomist reject the notion that plant and animal structures had been designed for divine purposes, rather that the researcher should understand those structures as having their raison d=etre in the functional organization of the entire creature. 

we should not marvel at a superior wisdom that supposedly designed the bark of the cork tree so fine wines could be preserved; rather we should try to understand how that part functioned within the organization of the tree itself and how it was affected by 11 its geographical circumstances. The relationship of organisms to their environment, according to Goethe, had to be regarded as non-intentional: the environment had an impact on creatures, changing their outward shape to conform to particular requirements, 

But that was only part of the story; for the internal structures of plants and animals showed another force at work. There was also an “inner kernel [innere Kern]” that provided a general corporeal pattern for an organism, which extrinsic forces might particularize in different ways: the seal, for instance, had a body formed by its aquatic environment, but its skeleton displayed the same general configuration as that of land mammals. Goethe thus concluded: The ultimate form [of a plant or animal] is constructed likewise from an inner kernel, which is given its particularity through the determination of external elements. In this way, an animal obtains its purposiveness in respect to the outer environment, since it is formed from the external as well as from the internal.20 Living organisms thus derived their structures from two forces, an intrinsic one, which provided a general pattern [Muster], and an extrinsic one, which shaped an organism to its particular circumstances. This latter, environmental force, Goethe conceived much as Lamarck and Darwin would, namely, as a direct effect on the organism that adapted it to particular circumstances (“purposiveness in respect to that external environment”). Goethe had replaced divine teleology with natural causality, th

First, he suggests here that the necessary concept we have of living beings assures us of their fundamental unity of type, a unity that nonetheless permits great variety in realization. Second, he thinks of this concept as being lawfully free (gesetzmässig-freie), a phrase and conception that seem to come straight from Kant=s description of aesthetic judgment as stemming from “the free lawfulness of the understanding [die freie Gesetzmässigkeit des Verstandes].” 23 Finally, when Goethe refers to the “productive genius of nature,” he obviously plays off of Kant’s own definition of genius as “nature giving the rules to art.” And he seems to suggest two aspects of this notion: that archetypes in nature constitute a productive force bringing particular organisms into existence; and that these archetypes are comprehended by the artist in the creation of beautiful objects (

Kant, of course, considers aesthetic judgments, as well as judgments of intrinsic teleology, not as determinative but as reflective; and such reflective judgments in the 14 case of organisms (i.e., teleological judgments) are regulative, that is, virtually hypothetical. Yet the archetype for Goethe, as he here thinks of it, is not merely a regulative consideration, since it is the same one that the productive genius of nature employs—to use Kantian terms, it would be determinative. Goethe=s residual Spinozism, according to which productive ideas reside in nature, imparts a decided turn to his newly adopted Kantianism,
