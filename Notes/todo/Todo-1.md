Peggy write about exp grateful imagery open vs closed state.  Closed is good bd. Conflict and peace.  Open conflict is vulnerability that despite nothingness there’s something. But desire is not hope.  It’s not that u want something but it’s knowing that something is as possible a something and one can’t be more open to one vs the other.  Practice of hope cultivated.  A walk is like meditating.  Meditating is eyes closed listening to breath is listening to footfall being open to surroundinginf imagery.  The mantra is reminder of presence underlying imagery.  Mantra is hope.  What calls?  Being open to the call of n image. Why does this image stand out for you.
