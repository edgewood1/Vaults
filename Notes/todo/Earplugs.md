# Earplugs


I am a musician.  i play acoustic guitar in an amplified setting, standing next to a drummer and a washboard player.  across from the drummer, is the fiddle, that i have to hear play notes clearly enough to change my chords accordingly.  The last two times i played, I’ve really hurt my ears due to the noise.  I have ringing, but i had physical pain.  it’s better now, but i want to make sure that i don’t repeat.  I did try wearing quiet loops, but they muffled the sound of the violin way too much.  can yoiu tell me what elements/criteria should be in earbuds that i purchase, and then give me some examples of good models.  finally, downbeats or earpeace - which is ready are better for my situaiton? **Essential Criteria for 

Your Situation**
To hear specific instruments clearly on an amplified stage, your earplugs should meet these criteria:
* **High-Fidelity/Flat Attenuation:** Standard foam or "quiet" plugs muffle sound because they block high frequencies (where the fiddle lives) more than low frequencies. Look for "flat attenuation" or "acoustic filters" that reduce volume evenly across the entire frequency spectrum.
* **Acoustic Filters (Not Solid Plugs):** These use physical diaphragms or "membranes" to let clear sound through at lower volumes, rather than just acting as a solid barrier.
* **Interchangeable Filters:** Given your history of physical pain, you likely need a higher level of protection than standard concert plugs. Look for models with swappable filters (e.g., 15dB, 19dB, 22dB) so you can find the balance between protection and clarity.
* **Vented Design:** This reduces the "occlusion effect" (the booming sound of your own voice or acoustic guitar inside your head), making your own playing feel more natural. 

## **Recommended Models for Musicians**
1. <u>**[Etymotic ER20XS](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462853881871958,imageDocid:4720543083360403813,gpcid:3595974111395020305,headlineOfferDocid:10003647778781145906,catalogid:5627726820237266053,productDocid:3451301490085134176,rds:PC_3595974111395020305%7CPROD_PC_3595974111395020305&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjh2Lyphp6SAxWT1vACHV2QOUwQxa4PegYIAQgIEAI)**</u>**:** A long-standing industry standard for musicians. It uses a tuned resonator and acoustic resistor to mimic the ear canal's natural response while dropping volume by ~20dB.
4. **Earasers:** Specifically designed for musicians. They have a very soft silicone build and a filter that focuses on a flat response, particularly helping to keep the high-end "sparkle" of acoustic instruments.
6. <u>**[Minuendo Lossless](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,imageDocid:11215834936917466498,headlineOfferDocid:8701696102548444709,productDocid:8701696102548444709&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjh2Lyphp6SAxWT1vACHV2QOUwQxa4PegYIAQgIEAc)**</u>**:** These feature a **manual volume slider** on the plug itself, allowing you to adjust attenuation between 7dB and 25dB without removing them.
