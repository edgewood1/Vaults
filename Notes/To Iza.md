Subject: Thinking about the 601 Markham lot
Hey Iza and Jack,

I wanted to reach out because I’ve been looking into what’s likely coming to the old church site at 601 W. Markham, and I thought the details might be worth sharing with a few folks. If you happen to have Joe’s contact info from next door, could you pass this along to him as well?

As you’ve probably noticed, the lot has been cleared by the owner, Devin Solow. Looking at his recent project down at 411 W. Markham, he seems to have a specific strategy for the neighborhood. He renovated that property and set up a long-term "master lease" with a fraternity, which allowed him to sell it as a high-yield investment for $1.2 million. Essentially, he’s found a way to turn residential houses into guaranteed income streams by focusing on high-occupancy student groups.

The 601 Markham lot looks like a possible next chapter. Because of the "multifamily" zoning, he can build a duplex or triplex without needing any public hearings or neighborhood input. While new development is great, his model has historically involved maximizing the number of bedrooms to drive up rent. Our concern is that this can turn a quiet residential corner into more of a "mini-dorm" setup, prioritizing high-turnover rentals over the long-term stability of the street.

We’ve already seen the effects of this at the 411 property. When a residential home shifts into a high-intensity rental, the street often becomes a midnight bottleneck for Ubers and party buses, paired with chronic trash issues and "seasonal mounds" of debris. Even though Duke Community Affairs has stepped in to help manage the noise disruptions this year, the sanitation issues are still very much a work in progress, requiring on-going communication with Duke.   

I’m reaching out because while Devon certainly has the right to develop the lot, he also has the responsibility to be a conscientious landlord. It’s entirely possible he’s already considering a more community-conscious approach for this site, but given the high demand for housing in Durham, there’s no reason he couldn't prioritize professionals or non-fraternity students from the start. He can still get a great return without locking in a fraternity lease that complicates the quality of life for everyone else.

I’m planning to reach out to him directly just to encourage a more thoughtful management approach before he settles on a tenant or signs a long-term contract. I’ve included his contact info below if you’re interested in doing the same—the more he hears that the neighborhood is invested in the long-term character of the street, the better.

Hey Iza and Jack,

The lot was cleared by the owner, Devin Solow. He’s the same developer who renovated 411-413 W. Markham a few years ago and set up a long-term "master lease" with a fraternity before selling it as a high-yield investment for $1.2 million.

Because of the multifamily zoning at 601, he can build a duplex or triplex "by-right" without needing public input. While new development is great, his history of maximizing bedroom counts often turns these lots into "mini-dorm" setups. We’ve seen the effects at the 411 property—specifically the midnight Uber/bus bottlenecks and chronic sanitation issues that Duke Community Affairs is still helping us manage.

Devon has the right to develop the lot, but he also has a responsibility to be a good landlord (to do so conscientiously?). Given the high demand for housing in Durham, he could easily prioritize professionals or grad students and still get a great return without the "fraternity" impact on our quality of life.

I’m planning to reach out to him directly to encourage a more thoughtful management approach before he signs any long-term leases. I’ve included his contact info below if you’d like to drop him a note as well—it's worth a shot to let him know the neighborhood is paying attention!
