To be Christian is to welcome, contemplate, and live within this strange story. And to me, it is Catholicism, more than any other form of Christianity, that fully celebrates the mystery of Incarnation that is the heart of the faith.
Choosing to become Catholic has, in part, been a realization that the way I think and see the world is already deeply Catholic. While the Protestant imagination can be said to be dialectic, thinking in terms of either/or and stressing the unlikeness of things, **[the Catholic imagination is analogic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0824506944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0824506944&linkCode=as2&tag=cothinlo-20)** — incarnational — seeing things in terms of likeness and unity, welcoming paradox. 

I’m clear on the definitions of actual and sanctifying grace as listed inn my initial post.  

My question has to do with the kind of grace that underlies all reality, and how it relates to these definitions.  

The more I consider it, the more they seem to be synonymous.

Some random quotes. 

“In all things,” Thomas Aquinas wrote, “God himself is properly the cause of universal being… in all things God works intimately.” Or as John Milbank writes, “Everything is therefore ‘engraced.’” 

There is no schism between faith and reason, between the sacred and secular, between the natural and the numinous; God, the ground of all Being, inhabits each of these realms. All of reality is engraced. — A Favale
 
The logic of the Incarnation brings us back to … engraced creation, and engraced creation … lead to Christ and the Incarnation.  — E. Ranstrom 

The most striking example of God’s determination to communicate with us through engraced matter is, of course, the Incarnation of the second Person of the Blessed Trinity, Christ Our Lord. — J Mirus
