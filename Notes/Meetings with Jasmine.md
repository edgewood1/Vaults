# Meetings with Jasmine

1. General overview - I demoed the component tree in React DevTools & breakpoint in Chrome devTools.
2. Walked her through these as she drove.  I also sent her a video of my moving through it. 
3. She had a week long PTO.
4. The following week, she couldn’t meetup because she was trying to catch up on things
5. The week after, we met up but her environment was messed up, so I helped troubleshoot that .  We fixed that & I gave pointers on her ticket, but we decided to meet the next day for her devTools demo, but she had other env issues, so I reviewed .map & .filter & how to chain them and suggested way to get good at that.  
6. This past week, I’ve been on PTO so couldn’t meet.
7. This Monday, she should review DevTools & array methods. 

My sense
- There’s good rapport, but most of our sessions have been marked by her being literally astonished at what I demo for her. 
- There’s a general sense that she’s still stuck in her processes, so not developing. 
- She’s working on an MA where they must learn python, and mentioned confusing methods in python, java, and JavaScript.   
- I think she should decide between pursuing the MA or pursing Osmosis as a non-intern.
