Objects have internal / external difference

Objects are physical and metaphysical. 

Symbols are objects that refer to other objects.

If objects refer to its interior, they are inherently symbolic constructs; if objects are distinct from other objects, they are potentially symbolic constructs.  Thus, objects are inherently symbolic, and potentially able to symbolize beyond this inherent meaning. 

Interpretation means connection object to their meaning (inherent essence).  This can never be done, so we seek other ways of doing it - we connect objects to other objects via symbolic order.  

How is the symbolic order created? 

Because all objects are filtered by larger systems, we can say there is no objectivity.

Inherent meaning = real essence > good benefits. 

But believing in this is a choice? Faith?

We can interpret in two ways: metaphorically and literalism.  Both are symbolic modes

Can we see without interpretation? Perception is inherently shaped by various factors, our brain is wired or organize sensory detail into mental schemas, and out body’s abilities and positionality also influences how we see a thing - what aspect of its sensuality we experience, and thus, the quality of our perception.  

ideas are not passive, they captivate us because they have internal difference
