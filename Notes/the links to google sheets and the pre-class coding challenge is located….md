the links to google sheets and the pre-class coding challenge is located in the lesson plans folder (as opposed to class content): 

02-lesson-plans/part-time/ week ? / day ? / ? lessonPlan.md

if there’s a google sheet, you can post the link on slack.  Zach usually slacks out the coding challenge, but if he’s super late, he will ask one of us to do that.
