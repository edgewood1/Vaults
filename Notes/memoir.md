When I grew up, my dad simply supported the current POTUS, regardless of party. 

But the changed in the 90’s when, for him, being a law-abiding American = being a Republican and being a Republican = being anti-welfare, anti-crime, both of which gradually morphed into anti-immigration (that is, illegal border-crossings in order to bask it northern welfare). 

These associations were pre-rational, and were the axioms upon which his rational arguments were built, a belief like ‘god is good’, ‘the sun will rise tomorrow’. 

Challenging these assumptions meant challenging his sense of being and, by extension, belonging. 
Since my very-brown dad has always been critical of other Puerto Ricans and other illegal iI’ve always wondered about ethnics who were critical of their own 





Life is full of problems that challenge our sense of belonging, and for some, the anti-immigration position seems a quick fix to one of these challenges.  this political position is a quick fix to the one of those - specifically, the possibility of being confused (whether by one’s self or others) for someone who doesn’t belong.
