# Part 1


<u>**1- three axes**</u>

**Our universe**
* **Three Familiar Axes:** Our everyday world operates along length, width, and height.
* **Scale and Complexity:** Our universe also varies in size (from nebulae to atoms) and complexity (from simple particles to living organisms).
* **Scales of Physics:** Different physical theories govern these scales:
	* Quantum mechanics for the subatomic.
	* Classical mechanics for our usual experience.
	* Relativity for large-scale spacetime.
**The Search for Unification**
* Seeking a Unified Theory: Reconciling these divergent views requires a comprehensive theory. Many physicists hypothesize the existence of additional dimensions beyond our familiar three of space and one of time.
* **Hidden Dimensions:** These dimensions might exist beyond our direct perception but could subtly influence our universe. Their spatial characteristics and interactions with our dimensions are key areas of inquiry.
**3 scales**  
In the way your branches sway in the wind, in the way your leaves and fruit fall, we observe the laws of classical mechanics. 
But if we narrow the lens, the texture of your bark gives way to intricate cellular structures, atoms, and ultimately particles governed by the strange rules of quantum mechanics
If we widen the lens, we see your roots are held in place by a land mass punctuated by water, by a planet bound to the gravitational forces of our sun and the dyad bound to the gravitational forces of our galaxy, galaxies positioned among one another as far as the eye can see.  When it comes to such distances the the spacetime fabric that defines them, we appeal to the laws of relativity 
Each scale seems to have its own set of rules, and each set of rules seems to counter one another.  This counter-punctual relationship can be reconciled through the unifying theory of strings, which assumes hidden dimensions.  
Three scales that each have 3 theories, but a unified theory assumes hidden dimensions.

<u>**Folded Space and dimensionality**</u>

The domain of subatomic particles operates by a set of rules that contradict those governing macroscopic bodies like stars and planets.

However, theorists have found ways to reconcile these contradictions through mathematical equations that assume the existence of alternative dimensions.  

These dimensions occupy the same space as our own, however, they exist in a different state or configuration than the one that allows us to exist and act in the ways we do.   Each dimension is a different way in which the fabric of our reality can be organized wihtin this shared space.  They are  different manifestations or aspects of the same overarching space.

Due to these different states, these dimensions are not readily perceptible to us, however they can affect us. 

Consider the way that water can assume the altered state that is gas, and thus become less perceptible to us while still affecting us (as gas does). 

Space is primary, and our reality is one way in which space is expressing itself.   There are other realities more fundamental than our own upon which ours is built or assumes, and there are others that build or assume our own -  each reality affecting all the others. 

We could imagine the presence of these configurations in one of two ways: 
* extra dimensions could be curled up into tiny imperceptible spaces within our reality
* they could exist alongside our own (parallel)

The points in our world are actualized by other points in our dimension or in that of another,  which we might call interiorized- or counter-space.  

One way we experience the effects of these dimensions: 
dark energy and matter, which contributes to expansion and contraction of the universe.
