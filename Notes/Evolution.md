Animal
Cave man
Human

Accidental. Members acts linearly one after next. 

- [ ] Animal created before human created 

If animal never existed, humans wouldn’t exist

However a human could exist without the active presence of those cavemen

The cavemen were a phase en route to human

Instrumental.  Members act simultaneously.  

- [ ] Sun embraces earth enables my walk thru park
- [ ] Sunlight rays i. Captured by chlorofill that initiates chemical reaction transforming into usiable energy
- [ ] Arist applies brush, skill, and intent.  
- [ ] We can talk about various actors simultaneously acting from various over layered dimensions as I act
- [ ] We can talk about various  agents doing this from a single dimension physical
- [ ] Various actors in past that has led to my taking this class 

If the earth didn’t exist a human wouldn’t be able to walk.  Other are needed. 



A modern human Can walk but boy without simultaneous presence of earth.
