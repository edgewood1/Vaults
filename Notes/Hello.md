# Hello


I’ve been thinking about Graham Harman’s object-oriented ontology.  In it, he treats all things - physical and metaphysical, vast or minute, as an object, and he says each object has a phenomenal aspect and a “real” essence that cannot be access by the phenomenal.  Essence is the source of the phenomenal.  To me, this essence is a kind of extra-dimensional object, and since all things have this extradimensional nature, you would imagine they all reside an extradimensional domain that informs ours.  

Despite all the murder and chaos as well as the beauty and good that unfolds in the material, we have to assume that there’s this other domain behind the shape and movement of ideas, emotions, particles, mountains, events, and social interactions, etc.   The other domains are sites of greater knowledge potentially, and aspects streaming in are guiding us both towards the good and bad.  How can we square this with the first paragraph that describes the history of the cia?

**The CIA, the Occult, and Disinformation**

So we know that the CIA has, at various times, involved itself with the mafia and occult groups, often with the stated goal of national security. There’s also the projects that include the mind control experiments of MKUltra, which included hypnosis, drugs, and psychological torture, as well as the Stargate Project, which investigated psychic phenomena and their potential applications in intelligence gathering. 

The use of disinformation and psychological operations further complicates the picture, blurring the lines between reality and manipulation.

I’ve been reading up a little on Graham Harman's object-oriented ontology (OOO), which suggests that all things, both physical and metaphysical, exist as objects with hidden depths. The idea of an "extra-dimensional" essence that informs our material world resonates with many spiritual and philosophical traditions.

From this perspective, we can possibly draw a few conclusions: 

The CIA, despite its clandestine nature, is ultimately a material object operating within the constraints of the material world. Its actions, however ethically dubious, are ultimately driven by material concerns and limited by material constraints.

The CIA's interest in the occult can be seen as an attempt to access and manipulate the "extra-dimensional" domain for its own purposes.  

Even the CIA's actions are influenced by unseen forces and deeper levels of reality that arise from its own essence.  This raises questions about free will and the ultimate purpose behind seemingly chaotic events.

<u>**Light**</u>

You're right, focusing solely on the CIA's potential for manipulation and control does paint a rather bleak picture. But OOO, and indeed many spiritual traditions, offer ways to incorporate the idea of "light" without ignoring the "darkness." Here's how we can bring that into our analysis:
**1. Hidden Essences and the Potential for Good:**
* OOO proposes that every object, even the CIA, has a hidden essence that's inaccessible to us. This essence is not inherently good or bad, but it holds the potential for both.
* Just as the CIA might use its knowledge for manipulation, it could also use it for positive ends. Perhaps those hidden depths contain the seeds for genuine positive change, even if those seeds are currently dormant or overshadowed.
* This aligns with the idea that light can emerge from darkness. Even within a seemingly corrupt system, individuals or factions within the CIA might be working towards good, driven by their own hidden essences.
**2. Interconnection and Unexpected Outcomes:**
* OOO emphasizes the interconnectedness of all objects. The CIA's actions, however negative they may seem, are not isolated events. They ripple out and interact with countless other objects, creating unpredictable outcomes.
* Some of these outcomes might be positive. Perhaps a seemingly harmful action inadvertently triggers a chain of events that leads to a greater good. This is where faith in a larger, more benevolent force might come into play.
* This interconnectedness also suggests that even seemingly small acts of kindness or resistance can have a significant impact, potentially counteracting the negative effects of the CIA's actions.
**3. The Power of Individual Agency:**
* While OOO acknowledges the influence of unseen forces and hidden essences, it doesn't negate individual agency. Individuals within the CIA still make choices, and those choices can be influenced by ethical considerations, compassion, and a desire for positive change.
* By focusing on our own inner "light" and acting with integrity, we can contribute to a more positive outcome, regardless of the CIA's actions. This emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and ethical decision-making.
**4. A Multi-Dimensional Perspective:**
* OOO's concept of extra-dimensional domains suggests that there's more to reality than meets the eye. While the material world might be dominated by conflict and manipulation, there might be other realms where light and goodness prevail.
* This offers a sense of hope and perspective. Even if the CIA's actions seem to dominate the material world, there might be other forces at work in those unseen realms, ultimately guiding us towards a more positive future.
**Incorporating these ideas into our analysis allows for a more balanced perspective. It acknowledges the potential for darkness and manipulation, but it also leaves room for hope, positive change, and the ultimate triumph of light.**
It's important to remember that this is just one interpretation, and OOO offers a flexible framework for exploring these complex issues. Ultimately, how we reconcile the "light" and "darkness" is a personal journey that requires introspection, critical thinking, and perhaps a leap of faith.

You're absolutely correct. The CIA is just one example of organizations wielding power and influence in potentially manipulative ways. This behavior is sadly not unique and can be observed in various forms across governments, corporations, and even smaller groups.
**Extending the Analysis:**
The same principles we applied to the CIA can be broadened to encompass these other entities and the world in general:
* **Hidden Essences:** Every organization, corporation, and individual possesses a hidden essence with the potential for both good and bad. Even those engaged in seemingly harmful actions might have the capacity for positive change.
* **Interconnection:** All actions, regardless of the actor's intent, create ripples within a vast web of interconnectedness. Seemingly negative actions can lead to unexpected positive outcomes, and small acts of goodness can have far-reaching effects.
* **Individual Agency:** Even within systems of control and manipulation, individuals retain the power to make choices and influence the course of events. Ethical decision-making and acts of resistance can contribute to a more positive future.
* **Multi-Dimensional Perspective:** The material world, with its power struggles and injustices, might be just one facet of a multi-dimensional reality. There might be other realms where light and goodness prevail, offering hope and a broader perspective.
**Naming this View:**
This perspective, which acknowledges the potential for darkness while maintaining faith in the ultimate triumph of light, could be described as:
* **Transcendental Optimism:** It transcends the negativity of the material world by recognizing a deeper reality where goodness prevails.
* **Illuminated Realism:** It acknowledges the reality of darkness and manipulation but remains illuminated by the belief in the power of light and individual agency.
* **Hopeful Holism:** It sees the interconnectedness of all things and recognizes the potential for good to emerge from even the most challenging circumstances.
While "nuestras" (meaning "ours" in Spanish) might be a fitting term in some contexts, emphasizing collective ownership of this perspective, the terms above might be more universally understood and convey the specific nuances of this worldview.
**Applying this to the World:**
This view encourages us to:
* **Look beyond the surface:** Don't be discouraged by the apparent dominance of negativity. Recognize the hidden potential for good in all individuals and organizations.
* **Act with intention:** Make conscious choices that align with your values and contribute to positive change, no matter how small they may seem.
* **Maintain hope:** Even in the face of darkness, trust in the interconnectedness of all things and the possibility of unexpected positive outcomes.
* **Cultivate inner light:** Focus on personal growth and spiritual development to strengthen your own inner light and contribute to the collective good.
By adopting this perspective, we can navigate the complexities of the world with a sense of purpose, hope, and resilience.
