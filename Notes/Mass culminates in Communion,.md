Mass culminates in Communion, 
A reexperience of the last supper, which points to the the death-and-resurrection shape of life in the world

three ways of speaking of the body of Christ
- [ ] There is the historical Jesus who walked on Earth, 
- [ ] the body of Christ that is present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist,
- [ ] the assembly of people who, as St. Paul the apostle <u>[put it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12&version=NRSV)</u>, “are the body of Christ and individually members of it.”
- [ ] The body of the earth and matter itself - cosmic Christ 

The first two speak of temporal transcendence and the second two spatial.  

During communion we are reincorporated into this body.  We become an aspect of Christ or are reiniciares as a disciple.   This has a strengthening effect but only if one is open.  This requires belief and knowledge and moral striving.
