1. **AI Workflows:** While you can create simple workflows linking standard tools (e.g., using Zapier to connect ChatGPT to Google Sheets), a _custom AI workflow_ implies something more specific to the business. This could involve:
    
    - Automating a unique internal process (like a specific type of document approval or data validation).   
        
    - Integrating custom-trained AI models as steps within the workflow.   
        
    - Handling proprietary data types or connecting with internal legacy systems in a way off-the-shelf tools can't easily manage.
    - **Example:** An insurance company building an automated workflow that uses custom AI models to analyze claim photos, extract specific data points unique to their forms, check against internal policy rules, and route it for specialized review – this is a custom AI workflow solution.
2. **AI Agents:** These are often prime examples of custom AI solutions. An AI agent is typically designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously to achieve specific goals within a company's environment. Custom AI agents are built when:   
    
    - The agent needs to be trained on the company's specific data (e.g., internal knowledge base, customer interaction history, specific technical documentation).   
        
    - It needs to perform actions within the company's unique software ecosystem or follow specific business logic.
    - It handles complex, multi-step tasks requiring reasoning tailored to the business context.   
        
    - **Example:** A custom AI agent designed for an e-commerce company to monitor customer support chats, identify complex return requests based on specific internal criteria, initiate the return process in their custom backend system, and draft a personalized response – this is a custom AI agent solution.   
        

In essence, if the workflow or agent isn't just a simple connection of generic tools but involves custom development, specific business logic, proprietary data integration, or addresses a unique operational need, it fits well within the "Custom AI Solution" category.
