Points to: [[Machine Learning]]

- **Machine Learning (ML):** The practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world. _This is currently the most dominant approach within AI._   
    
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. (Modern NLP heavily relies on ML/DL).
- **Computer Vision (CV):** Focuses on enabling computers to "see" and interpret visual information from images or videos. (Modern CV heavily relies on ML/DL).
- **Robotics:** Concerned with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, often integrating various AI techniques (including ML, CV, planning).
- **Symbolic AI / Rules-Based Systems / Expert Systems:** An older approach focused on explicitly programming human knowledge and logical rules into a system. Still used in some contexts.
- **Planning, Scheduling, and Optimization:** Algorithms focused on finding optimal sequences of actions or resource allocations.
- _(Others exist, like Knowledge Representation & Reasoning, Search Algorithms, etc., but these are some primary areas)._
