Maps the request's URL and method to the appropriate request handler.

Routing: If the request wasn't handled by middleware (e.g., it's not for a static asset), the server's router determines which request handler function should process the request based on the URL and method. The router distinguishes between:

- **Page Requests:** Requests for HTML pages (usually GET requests to URLs that represent pages).
- **API Requests:** Requests for data (often GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to URLs starting with `/api/...`).
