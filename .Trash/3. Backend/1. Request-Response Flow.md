# Client Request Flow

## 1. User Action
User types `www.example.com` into the browser's address bar and presses Enter (or clicks a link to that URL). This elicits an HTTP request.

## 2. HTTP Request
The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server. The request includes:

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **URL:** `/` (the root path)
*   **Headers:**
    ```http
    Host: www.example.com  (Tells the server *which* website is being requested)
    User-Agent: ... (Information about the browser)
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,... (Specifies the content types the browser can accept)
    Accept-Language: ...
    ... (and other headers)
    ```

## 3. Server Processing
(See [[2. Request Pipeline/1. Middleware]] and [[3. Handlers/1. Request Handlers]])

## 4. Client Receives and Processes
*   The browser receives the HTTP response.
*   It parses the response based on the `Content-Type` header.
*   **If HTML:** The browser parses the HTML, constructs the DOM (Document Object Model), and *makes additional requests* for any linked resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) specified in the HTML.
*   **If JSON:** The browser (or JavaScript code running in the browser) parses the JSON data.
*   The browser renders the page (for HTML) or processes the data (for JSON).

### Example HTTP Response (HTML)
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: ...
Date: ...
Server: ...

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  ... (HTML content) ...
</html>
```

### Example HTTP Response (JSON)
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: ...
Date: ...
Server: ...

{
  "message": "Hello, world!"
}
```

### Common Content-Types
*   `text/html`: (Most common for initial page requests)
*   `application/json`: (Common for API requests)
*   `application/xml`: (Less common)
*   `text/plain`: (Simple text responses)
*   `application/octet-stream`: (Generic binary data, usually triggers a download)
