NX Workspace primarily fits within a new category focused on 

**Developer Experience (DevEx), Tooling, and Architecture/DevOps**, as it manages the structure, tooling, and build process of your entire repository rather than specific application functions like routing, rendering, or database interactions.

Here is how NX fits into your blog's structure and suggestions for a new category:

New Category: DevEx & Architecture (or DevOps/Infrastructure)

NX is a monorepo management tool. It optimizes the development workflow across multiple projects within a single repository, which is a concern separate from the application's runtime logic. This deserves its own category in a full-stack blog.

This category should cover topics related to _how_ you build, organize, test, and deploy your Next.js applications.

Where NX Fits

- **NX Workspace:** Fits perfectly in the new `DevEx & Architecture` category. It is a tool for managing project boundaries, shared libraries, consistent tooling, and efficient build caching in a monorepo setup.

Other Topics That Fit the New Category

You can populate this category with topics that concern the broader development environment, continuous integration/delivery, and project management:

Build Tools & Package Management

- **Yarn / NPM / PNPM:** The choice of package manager and how you manage dependencies and workspaces (especially relevant in a monorepo).
- **Module Bundlers (Webpack/ESBuild/Turbopack):** While often configured by Next.js internally, discussing their role and configuration options for performance fits here.
- **Linting & Formatting (ESLint/Prettier):** Tools ensuring code quality and consistency across the entire workspace.

Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins:** Automating the testing, building, and deployment pipelines for your Next.js projects.
- **Deployment Platforms (Vercel/Netlify/AWS Amplify):** Discussing infrastructure and hosting solutions.

Infrastructure & Operations (DevOps)

- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Containerization strategies for deploying full-stack Next.js applications in scalable environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform/Pulumi):** Managing the cloud infrastructure where your database and application servers run.
