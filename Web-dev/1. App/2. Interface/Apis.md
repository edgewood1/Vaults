WebSockets: A protocol for establishing persistent, bidirectional communication between a client and server, ideal for real-time applications like chat or live updates. 

SOAP APIs: A more complex API using XML for data exchange, providing robust security features. 

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call): A high-performance RPC framework developed by Google, often used for microservices communication. 

MQTT: A lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices like IoT sensors, with a publish/subscribe pattern
