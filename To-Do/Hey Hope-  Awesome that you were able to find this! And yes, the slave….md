Hey Hope.  Awesome that you were able to find this! And yes, the slave cemetery is on Margaret Lane.  I appreciate that article. 


I’d been meaning to share these.  An article about his [dad’s store](https://mountainx.com/news/774835/).  

Seems like there’s also a [memorial angel](https://docsouth.unc.edu/commland/monument/490/) statue at the site of the old shop.

And the [family house](https://www.exploreasheville.com/article/look-homeward-thomas-wolfe-fans) is not far away.
