Issues
- roof rack should be considered alongside roof storage - they should constitute 1 “thing”. 
- It seems Yakima is more popular than Thule; one post showed a Thule clamp not fully embracing the crossbar without removing some cross bars on the prinsu 
- Are crossbars alone easily moveable and able to handle the lighting rack? 
- **Ultimately, our ask will be: we want a Prinsu-like setup with light rack, canopy, that can handle Yakima/Thule-like storage container of XXL without the need to remove bars or other small adjustments.**  
- To reach up, we could use the runners boards for starters. Maybe add ladder later
- We can add the lights later to since that will require an electrician unless Blair can handle that himself.  If so we should ask him about camera

	1. Roam small for price … even with 2 it’s only 320L storage. Perhaps the Thule is better unless a roof top tent is needed.
