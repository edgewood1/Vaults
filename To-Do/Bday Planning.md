BRACELETS: rubber band bracelets are quick and easy

NECKLACES
* Separate the beads by type and give each kid a **plastic tray (dollar store**) to organize their necklaces.  
* Measure length of ideal length to slip over head but not too long. 
* Pre-cut Strands of elastic. 
* Measure length of ideal length of beads - Mark on a sheet of paper so that can lay it out
* Emmy can be the finisher once the necklaces are assembled. She can help if a kid gets stuck putting on a bead. 
* Knot off each end so the beads stay down, then knot the top. 
* She can practice one before kids arrive

**EMMY Ideas via text: KP and Emmy to talk Saturday late morning to solidify plan so KP can purchase anything needed**

Perfect, thanks for the details — this helps a lot. I’ll lay out a party schedule that balances *structured crafts* with *movement and variety*, uses your spaces wisely, and keeps things flowing so the kids don’t get restless. I’ll also note when/where adults can comfortably hang out.

⸻

**7-Year-Old Birthday Party Schedule (6 Girls Total, 2 Hours)**

**Arrival & Opening (15 min, Kitchen/Dining Area or Porch)**
	•	**Where:** Kitchen island or dining table (parents can mingle nearby with drinks/snacks).
	•	**Activity:** Simple **bracelet making (rubber band bracelets)** or **sticker collages** — quick, no mess, and easy for kids to start/stop as they arrive.
	•	*Why:* Settles kids down while waiting for everyone, requires little instruction, parents can chat close by.

⸻

**Main Craft Rotation (60 min, Back Porch → Kitchen/Dining Table)**

Led by the teenager (“activity leader”). Break into 2–3 shorter blocks so kids don’t fatigue.
	1.	**Necklaces (20–25 min)**
	•	**Where:** Dining table moved to back porch (plenty of light, contained space, easy cleanup).
	•	Pre-cut elastic, trays of beads, layout sheets.
	•	Teenager + birthday girl can help finish/close necklaces.
	2.	**Paper Plate Animals/Masks (20 min)**
	•	**Where:** Same porch table or backyard table if weather’s nice.
	•	Craft supplies: plates, markers, yarn, glue, stickers.
	•	Adds variety, more playful and silly.
	3.	**Optional Quick Craft or Game (15 min)**
	•	**Ideas:**
	•	**Friendship weaving** (kumihimo, cardboard looms — quiet, relaxing)
	•	**Saltwater watercolor painting** (low mess, quick drying)
	•	Or **game** if kids need movement: *“Animal Charades”* or *Freeze Dance* in backyard.

⸻

**Cake & Singing (20 min, Backyard)**
	•	**Where:** Backyard table.
	•	Parents can gather around here too.
	•	**Flow:** Sing Happy Birthday → serve cake/fruit/snacks.
	•	Leave 10–15 min for chatting and eating.

⸻

**Closing Activity (10–15 min, Backyard or Porch)**
	•	**Calm-down option:** Sticker collage or watercolor.
	•	**Active option:** Balloon play (helium if available, or regular balloons for games like “Keep It Up” in backyard).

⸻

**Space & Flow Notes**
	•	**Backyard**: Best for cake, singing, and any active play. Make safe by clearing tripping hazards.
	•	**Screened porch**: Great craft zone with table moved in. Carpeting keeps it comfy for kids.
	•	**Kitchen/dining**: Good arrival zone + adult hangout with food/drinks. Parents can drift between porch/backyard easily.

⸻

⏱️ **Sample Timeline (2 hrs)**
	•	0:00–0:15 → Arrival & quick craft (bracelets/stickers)
	•	0:15–0:40 → Necklaces (porch)
	•	0:40–1:00 → Paper plate animals/masks (porch/backyard)
	•	1:00–1:15 → Optional game or quick craft
	•	1:15–1:35 → Cake & Happy Birthday (backyard)
	•	1:35–1:50 → Balloon play or sticker collage wind-down
	•	1:50–2:00 → Pick-up / free play

⸻

Would you like me to also suggest a **backup rainy-day version** (all indoors using kitchen + porch), just in case?
