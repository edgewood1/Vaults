# 4-runner Cargo box

with your materials and the hole sizes (4–7” with bent fiberglass), here’s a **detailed, step-by-step guide** to structurally repair and refinish the cargo box.

⸻

🔧 **Materials You Have (for reference)**
	•	Fiberglass mat & cloth
	•	Fiberglass resin (likely epoxy or polyester)
	•	Cream hardener (for filler)
	•	Bonding filler (e.g., Bondo or similar)
	•	Spray adhesive
	•	Plastic spreaders
	•	Sandpaper
	•	Rust-Oleum automotive primer & paint
	•	Gloves, mixing cups, stir sticks (recommended)

🧰 **Step-by-Step Repair Instructions**

⸻

✅ **1. Prep the Area**
	1.	**Clean the area** with soap and water, then wipe with acetone or alcohol to remove oils or residue.
	2.	**Remove loose or delaminated fiberglass**. Use a utility knife or grinder if needed.
	3.	**Grind/sand around each hole** (2–3 inches around it) with 60–80 grit sandpaper. You need a rough surface for bonding.
	4.	**Flatten bent fiberglass**:
	•	Use a heat gun carefully to **soften and reshape** fiberglass if it’s just bent outward.
	•	If it’s cracked or shattered, you can **cut it flush** and patch over it.

⸻

✅ **2. Backer Support (if the hole goes completely through)**

If the hole is open and there’s nothing to support the patch underneath:
	•	**Tape a piece of cardboard or plastic** behind the hole from inside the box, or
	•	Temporarily tape a piece of **wax paper or foil-covered board** as a backing surface.
	•	This gives your resin/fiberglass mat something to form against until cured.

⸻

✅ **3. Cut Fiberglass Layers**
	•	Cut **2–4 layers** of **mat** slightly larger than the hole (each layer ~½” bigger than the last).
	•	If using **cloth** for a smooth final layer, cut it slightly larger than the patch area.
	•	Lay them aside in order.

⸻

✅ **4. Apply Fiberglass Patch**

**Optionally use spray adhesive to lightly tack the first mat layer in place.**
	1.	**Mix your resin** (follow label instructions — typically 1:10 or per ratio given). If you’re using **epoxy**, it comes with its own liquid hardener.
	•	Only mix small batches (resin heats up fast!).
	2.	**Brush a layer of resin** on the sanded area around the hole.
	3.	**Apply first mat layer** over hole. **Dab resin** on top with a spreader or brush until fully soaked. Don’t “brush” it — **pat it in**.
	4.	**Apply 2–3 more mat layers**, soaking each fully with resin.
	5.	(Optional) Add **cloth layer on top** for smoother finish.

Let it cure fully (check your resin instructions — usually 2–8 hours depending on temperature).

⸻

✅ **5. Sand and Fill**
	1.	Sand patch edges smooth (80–120 grit).
	2.	Mix your **filler with cream hardener** (follow filler instructions — usually a golf-ball size blob of filler to a 1-inch ribbon of hardener).
	3.	Apply filler in **thin layers** over patch to smooth transitions and shape the surface.
	4.	Let cure (~20–30 minutes), then **sand with 120–220 grit** until smooth.

Repeat filler/sanding if needed.

⸻

✅ **6. Prime and Paint**
	1.	Clean area with a dry rag.
	2.	Apply **1–2 coats of primer** (e.g., Rust-Oleum automotive primer). Let dry between coats.
	3.	Sand lightly with 400 grit if needed.
	4.	Apply **2–3 light coats of paint**, drying 5–10 minutes between coats.
	5.	(Optional) Finish with **clear coat** for UV and weather protection.

Let paint cure 24–48 hours before full use.

⸻

🧼 **Cleanup Tips**
	•	Use **acetone** on tools before resin hardens.
	•	Dispose of any resin or filler with care — it can get hot in the trash.

📝 **Summary Timeline**

**Step**	**Time Needed**
Prep & shaping	30–60 min
Fiberglass patching	1–2 hrs (plus cure time)
Sand & fill	1–2 hrs (including dry time)
Prime & paint	1–2 hrs (plus drying)
