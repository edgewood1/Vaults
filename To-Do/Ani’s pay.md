# Ani’s pay


Based on the pattern in the table, the wage increases by $0.60 for every half-year of age. To determine the wage for age 14, we'll follow this same pattern backward from age 15. The wage for age 14 will be $13.40. I've updated the table to include the new "Years" column and the row for age 14.
I've capped the table at age 20 for now. If you'd like me to extend it past age 20, just let me know.

Actual: 

*Ani’s wage table!*  

The primary reference for calculations is the **years column**, with age serving as an **approximation**.
* Ani's start date: February 4, 2024.
* If Ani takes more than six months, the age column will be adjusted, and her rate upon returning will be the same as her rate before the leave. 
* Each payment must specify the number of hours worked.
* Any bonus, fees for late payments, or reimbursement for food expenses will be issued as a separate transfer & labeled as such
* We’re very grateful.
