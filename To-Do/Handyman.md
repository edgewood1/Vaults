Handyman

I super highly recommend Alfred Udah- he’s done all kinds of jobs, big and small for me over the last 2.5 years, and he is awesome.
 
He’s punctual, professional, friendly, is super reasonably priced, and can do anything! 
He’s helped me with plumbing, moving and assembling furniture, electrical work, and punch list items. 
 
Everyone I’ve recommended him to has also told me he did a great job for them. 
 
His number is <u>(919) 438-0062</u>
 
Cheers,
