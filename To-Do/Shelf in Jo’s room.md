# Shelf in Jo’s room


9 vertical planks 
Bottom and top planks are part of the frame
Bottom plank on the floor
Top plan part of the ceiling
Each plank is approx 1” thick
Distance between floor and ceiling: Total Height: 96 inches
 * Wood Occupied: 9 inches (9 boards \times 1" thick)
 * Remaining Open Space: 87 inches (96" - 9")
 * Number of Spaces: 8 (Since the top and bottom are boards, there are 8 gaps between the 9 boards)

**Option 2: The "Split" Solution (Keeping some 12.5" shelves)**
 * 4 Spaces @ 12.5" (Total 50")
 * 4 Spaces @ 9.25" (Total 37")
 * Total Space: 87"
* You can alternate them (Large, Small, Large, Small) or group them (4 Large at the bottom, 4 Small at the top). 9.25" is still a very functional height for standard paperback books and smaller hardcovers.

Horizontal planks 
* two for the walls
* Two for the dividers (1-2 dividers per shelf).

You will buy that sheet and have it cut (ripped) into four strips that are **12 inches wide by 8 feet long**.
• **Result:** You now have 32 feet of shelving for about **$90–$100**.
• **Problem:** The front edge will look like ugly layered stripes (plywood layers).

To get the thick, solid-wood look you want, you don't use the plywood edge. You cover it with a piece of solid Red Oak trim. You have two choices here:
**Option A: The "Chunky" Look (Recommended)**
Glue and nail a 1x2 solid Red Oak board to the front face of the plywood.
• **Visual Result:** The shelf will look **1.5 inches thick** (very high-end/custom).
• **Structural Benefit:** This strip acts like a beam, making the shelf incredibly stiff so it won't sag.

Plywood is made like a sandwich. It creates a very strong board, but the edge looks like a "layer cake" of stripes.
 * The Face (Top/Bottom): Looks like beautiful, real wood grain.
 * The Edge (Side): Looks like rough, striped construction material.
If you don't cover that edge, the bookshelf will look like a garage storage unit rather than indoor furniture.

3. The "Board on the Front" (Nosing)
Since you cannot use an iron, nailing a board to the front is actually the best method for you. It is stronger and looks much better than the iron-on tape anyway.
This technique is called adding a "Nosing" or "Face Strip."
Why do this?
 * Hides the Ugly Layers: It covers the striped plywood edge with solid, pretty wood.
 * The "Chunky" Illusion: You are using 3/4" plywood (standard thickness). But if you nail a 1.5" wide board to the front, your shelf looks like a massive 1.5" thick slab of timber from the front, even though it's hollow/thin behind it.
 * Strength (Very Important): Plywood can sag over time. Gluing a solid wood strip to the front acts like a steel I-beam. It makes the shelf incredibly stiff so it won't bow under heavy books.

4. How to do it with Simple Tools (No Iron)
You do not need fancy clamps or irons. You just need Wood Glue (like Titebond II), a Hammer, and Finish Nails.
The Process:
 * Cut: Cut your solid 1x2 oak board to the exact length of your shelf.
 * Glue: Squeeze a bead of wood glue along the ugly plywood edge.
 * Position: Place the 1x2 oak board against the glue. Align it so the top of the trim is flush (even) with the top of the plywood shelf. (The extra thickness will hang down below, which is fine—it hides the shelf supports!).
 * Nail: Use small "finish nails" (1.5 inches long) to nail the oak board into the plywood edge. Space them about every 6-8 inches.
 * Wipe: Wipe away any squeezed-out glue immediately with a damp rag.
Result: A shelf that looks 1.5" thick, is super strong, and uses zero iron-on tape.
